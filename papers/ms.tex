  Stellar positions and velocities from Gaia are yielding a new window
  on
  open cluster dispersal.  Here we present an analysis of a
  group stars spanning Cepheus ($l=100^\circ$) to Hercules
  ($l=40^\circ$), hereafter the Cep-Her complex.
  The group includes four Kepler Objects of Interest:
  Kepler-1643 b ($R_{\rm p} = 2.32 \pm 0.14\,R_\oplus$, $P = 5.3\ {\rm days}$),
  KOI-7368 b ($R_{\rm p} = 2.22 \pm 0.12\,R_\oplus$, $P = 6.8\ {\rm days}$), 
  KOI-7913 Ab ($R_{\rm p} = 2.34 \pm 0.18\,R_\oplus$, $P = 24.2\ {\rm days}$), and
  Kepler-1627 Ab ($R_{\rm p} = 3.85 \pm 0.11\,R_\oplus$, $P = 7.2\ {\rm days}$).
  The latter Neptune-sized planet is in part of the Cep-Her
  complex called the $\delta$\ Lyr\ cluster
  \citep{bouma_kep1627_2022}.  Here we focus on the former three
  systems, which are in other regions of the association.  Based on
  kinematic evidence from Gaia, stellar rotation periods from TESS,
  and spectroscopy, these three objects are also $\approx$40 million
  years (Myr) old.  More specifically, we find that Kepler-1643 is
  $46^{+9}_{-7}$\,Myr old, based on its membership in a dense
  sub-cluster of the complex called RSG-5.  KOI-7368 and KOI-7913 are
  $36^{+10}_{-8}$\,Myr old, and are in a diffuse region that we call
  CH-2.  Based on the transit shapes and high resolution imaging, all
  three objects are most likely planets, with false positive
  probabilities of $6\times10^{-9}$, $4\times10^{-3}$, and
  $1\times10^{-4}$ for Kepler-1643, KOI-7368, and KOI-7913
  respectively.  These planets empirically demonstrate that
  mini-Neptunes with sizes of $\sim$2 Earth radii exist at ages of
  40 million years.

\section{Introduction}

The discovery and characterization of planets younger than
a billion years is a major frontier in current exoplanet research.
The reason is that the properties of young planets provide benchmarks
for studies of planetary evolution.  For instance, young planets can
inform our understanding
of when hot Jupiters arrive on their close-in orbits
\citep{dawson_johnson_2018}, how the sizes of planets with massive
gaseous envelopes evolve \citep{rizzuto_tess_2020}, the timescales for
close-in multiplanet systems to fall out of resonance
\citep{arevalo_stability_2022,goldberg_architectures_2022}, and
whether and how mass-loss explains the radius valley
\citep{lopez_how_2012,Owen_Wu_2013,Fulton_et_al_2017,ginzburg_corepowered_2018,lee_primordial_2021}.

The discovery of a young planet requires two claims to be true:
the planet must exist, and its age must be secured.  Spaced-based
photometry from K2 and TESS has yielded a number of exemplars for
which the planetary evidence comes from transits, and the age is based
on either cluster membership
\citep{Mann_et_al_2017,david_four_2019,newton_tess_2019,bouma_cluster_2020,nardiello_pathosII_2020}
or else on correlates of youth such as stellar rotation, photospheric
lithium content, x-ray activity, and emission line strength
\citep{zhou_2021_tois,hedges_toi-2076_2021}.

In this work, we leverage recent analyses of the Gaia data, which have
greatly expanded our knowledge of stellar groups \citep[{\it
e.g.},][]{CantatGaudin2018a,KounkelCovey2019,Kerr2021}.  To date these
analyses have mostly clustered on stellar positions and 2-D
velocities.  One important result has been the discovery of
diffuse streams and tidal tails comparable in stellar mass to the
previously known cores of nearby open clusters
\citep{meingast_psceri_2019,Meingast2021,gagne_number_2021}.  Even
though these streams are spread over tens to hundreds of
parsecs, their velocity dispersions can remain coherent at the
$\sim$1\kms\ level.  Internal dynamics and projection effects can also
drive them to be much larger: in the Hyades,
stars in the tidal tails are expected to span up to $\pm 40\mkms$ in velocity
relative to the cluster center \citep{jerabkova_800_2021}.
The stars in such diffuse regions can be verified to be the same age
as the core cluster members through analyses of
color-absolute magnitude diagrams \citep{KounkelCovey2019}, stellar
rotation periods \citep{curtis_tess_2019,bouma_2021_ngc2516}, and
chemical abundances \citep{hawkins_2020}.  While there are 
implications for our understanding of star formation and cluster
evolution \citep{dinnbier_tidal_2020}, a separate consequence is that
we now know the ages of many more stars, including previously known
planet hosts.

The prime Kepler mission \citep{borucki_kepler_2010} found most of the
currently known transiting exoplanets, and it was conducted before
Gaia.  It is therefore sensible to revisit the Kepler field, given our
new knowlege of the stellar ages.

In this work, we expand on our earlier study of a $38^{+7}_{-6}$ Myr
old Neptune-sized planet in the Kepler field (Kepler-1627~Ab;
\citealt{bouma_kep1627_2022}).  This planet's age was derived
based on its host star's membership in the $\delta$\ Lyr\ cluster.
While our analysis of the cluster focused on the immediate vicinity of
Kepler-1627 in order to have a reasonable scope,  it became
clear that the $\delta$\ Lyr\ cluster seems to
also be part of a much larger group of similarly aged stars.  This
group, which is at a distance of $\sim$330\,pc from the Sun, 
spans Cepheus to Hercules (galactic longitudes, $l$, between
40$^\circ$ and 100$^\circ$), at galactic latitudes between
0$^\circ$ and 20$^\circ$.  We therefore refer to it as the Cep-Her
complex.  It exhibits significant sub-structure over its $\approx$250
parsec length, and a detailed analysis of its memberships, kinematics,
and possible origin is currently being prepared by R.~Kerr and
collaborators.

Here, our focus is on the intersection of the Cep-Her complex with the
Kepler field.  Cross-matching our Cep-Her members against known Kepler
Objects of Interest (KOIs; \citealt{thompson_planetary_2018}) yielded
four candidate cluster members: Kepler-1627, Kepler-1643, KOI-7368,
and KOI-7913.  Given our earlier analysis of Kepler-1627, we focus
here on the latter three objects.  After analyzing the relevant properties of
Cep-Her (Section~\ref{sec:cluster}), we derive the stellar properties
(Section~\ref{sec:stars}) and validate the planetary nature of each
system using a combination of the Kepler photometry and
high-resolution imaging (Section~\ref{sec:planets}).  We conclude with
a discussion of mini-Neptune size evolution, and point out possible
directions for future work (Section~\ref{sec:disc_conc}).

\subsection{Previous Related Work}

Our focus is on a region of the Galaxy approximately 200 to 500\,pc
from the Sun, above the galactic plane, and spanning galactic
longitudes of roughly $40^\circ$ to $100^\circ$.  Two rich
clusters in this region are the $\delta$~Lyra cluster
\citep{stephenson_possible_1959} and RSG-5 \citep{roser_nine_2016}.
Each of these clusters was known before Gaia.  Their reported ages
are between 30 and 60\,Myr.  Early empirical
evidence that these two clusters could be part of a large and more
diffuse population was apparent in the Gaia-based photometric analysis
of pre-main-sequence stars by \citet[][see their Figures~11
and~13]{Zari2018}.  Further kinematic connections and complexity were
highlighted by \citet{KounkelCovey2019}, who included these previously
known groups in the larger structures dubbed ``Theia~73'' and
``Theia~96''\footnote{See their visualization online at
\url{http://mkounkel.com/mw3d/mw2d.html} (accessed 15 March 2022)}.
The connection made by \citet{KounkelCovey2019} between the previously
known open clusters and the other groups in the region was made as
part of an unsupervised clustering analysis of the Gaia DR2 positions
and on-sky velocities with a subsequent manual ``stitching'' step.
Their results support the idea that there is an overdensity of
30 to 60\,Myr old stars in this region of
the Galaxy.  \citet{Kerr2021}, in a volume-limited analysis of the
Gaia DR2 point-source catalog out to one third of a kiloparsec,
identified three of the nearest sub-populations, dubbed
``Cepheus-Cygnus'', ``Lyra'', and ``Cerberus''.  \citet{Kerr2021}
reported ages for each of these subgroups between 30 and 35 Myr.


\subsection{Member Selection}
\label{subsec:members}

The possibility that the $\delta$~Lyr cluster, RSG-5, and the
sub-populations identified by \citet{Kerr2021} share a common origin
has yet to be fully substantiated, and is the subject of the upcoming
study by R.~Kerr and collaborators.  Our primary interest in the
region stems from the fact that a portion of it was observed by Kepler
(Figure~\ref{fig:XYZvtang}, top panel).  To further explore the
population of stars that were observed, we select candidate Cep-Her
members through four steps, the first three being identical to those
described in Section~3 of \citet{Kerr2021}.  We briefly summarize them
here.

The first step is to select stars that are photometrically distinct
from the field star population based on Gaia EDR3 magnitudes $\{G,
G_{\rm RP}, G_{\rm BP}\}$, parallaxes and auxiliary reddening
estimates \citep{lallement_gaia-2mass_2019}.  This step yielded \npms\
stars with high-quality photometry and astrometry.  These stars are
either pre-main-sequence K and M dwarfs due to their long contraction
timescales, or massive stars near the zero-age main sequence due to
their rapid evolutionary timescales.

The second step is to perform an unsupervised HDBScan clustering on
the photometrically selected population
\citep{campello_hierarchical_2015,mcinnes_hdbscan_2017}.  The
parameters we use in the clustering are $\{ X, Y, Z, c v_b, c v_{l^*}
\} $, where $c$ is the size-velocity corrective factor, which is taken
as $c=6\,{\rm pc / km\,s}^{-1}$ to ensure that the spatial and
velocity scales have identical standard deviations.  Positions are
computed assuming the \texttt{astropy v4.0} coordinate standard
\citep{astropy_2018}, which places the Sun $8122$ pc from the galactic
center, and assumes the solar velocity with respect to the local
standard of rest from \citet{schonrich_local_2010}.  As input
parameters to HDBScan, we set the minimum $\epsilon$ threshold past
which clusters cannot be fragmented as $25$\,pc in physical space, and
$c$\,\kms\ in velocity.  The minimum cluster size $N$ is set to 10, as
is $k$, the parameter used to define the ``core distance'' density
metric. 

This unsupervised clustering in our case yielded 8 distinct groups.
These groups are then used as the ``seed'' populations for the third
step, which is to search for objects at least as close to the 10$^{\rm
th}$ nearest HDBSCAN-identified member in space-velocity coordinates.
This third step yields stars that are spatially and kinematically
close to the photometrically young stars, but which cannot be
identified as young based on their positions in the color-absolute
magnitude diagram.

The outcome of the analysis up to the point of the third step is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:XYZvtang}.  To enable a selection cut that filters
out field-star contaminants, we also compute a weight metric, defined
such that the group member with the smallest core distance has a
weight of 1, the group member with the greatest core distance has a
weight of 0, and weights for the other group members are log-normally
distributed between these two extremes.  In Figure~\ref{fig:XYZvtang},
we show 12{,}436 objects with weight exceeding 0.02 as gray points,
and overplot 4{,}763 objects with weights exceeding 0.10 as black
points.\footnote{These counts only include objects with reliable
astrometry and photometry: $\varpi/\sigma_\varpi>5$;
$G/\sigma_{G}>50$; $G_{\rm RP}/\sigma_{G_{RP}}>20$; $G_{\rm
BP}/\sigma_{G_{BP}}>20$.} The previously known $\delta$~Lyr\ cluster
is visible at $(l,b)=(68^\circ,15^\circ$) and $(v_{l'}, v_b)=(-4.5
,-4 )\mkms$.  RSG-5 is visible at $(l,b)=(83^\circ,6^\circ)$,
$(v_{l'}, v_b)=(5.5 ,-3.5 )\mkms$.  Most of the other
subclusters, including in Cep-Cyg ($l,b=90^\circ,7^\circ$) and
Cerberus ($l,b=48^\circ,18^\circ$) are too small or dispersed to have
previously been analyzed in great detail.

%
% KOI match numbers from calc_CepHer_group_numbers.py
%
Our fourth and final step was to cross-match the candidate Cep-Her
member list against all known Kepler Objects of Interest.  We used the
Cumulative KOI table from the NASA Exoplanet Archive from 27 March
2022, and also compared against the \texttt{q1\_q17\_dr25} table
\citep{thompson_planetary_2018}.  From the candidate members
with weights exceeding 0.02, this yielded
 yielded 11 were known false positives, 6 ``confirmed'' planets, and 8
 ``candidate'' planets.  
Inspection of the Kepler data validation summaries and Robovetter
classifications for these objects showed whether they were
potentially consistent with being {\it i)} planets, and {\it ii)}
$\lesssim 10^8$ years old, based on the presence of rotational
modulation at the expected period and amplitude \citep[{\it
e.g.},][Figure~9]{rebull_rotation_2020}.  Four objects remained after
this inspection: Kepler-1627, Kepler-1643, KOI-7368, and
KOI-7913.\footnote{These figures
yield an estimate of the size of Cep-Her: if our 4/14
possible matches represent the true positive rate, then
multiplying by the number of stars above our weight threshold
(12{,}436) yields $\approx$3{,}500 stars in the complex.}

Figure~\ref{fig:XYZvtang} shows the positions of the KOIs along
various projections.  Kepler-1643 is near the core RSG-5 population
both spatially and kinematically.  KOI-7368 and KOI-7913 are in a 
diffuse region $\approx$40\,pc above RSG-5 in $Z$ and $\approx$100\,pc
closer to the Sun in $Y$.  In tangential galactic velocity space,
there is some kinematic overlap between the region the
latter two KOIs are in and the main RSG-5 group.

%
% Numbers are from RSG-5_auto_XYZ_vl_vb_cut.csv,
% CH-2_auto_XYZ_vl_vb_cut.csv
%
We define two sets of stars in the local vicinity of our objects of
interest.  For candidate RSG-5 members, we require:
\begin{align}
  X/{\rm pc} &\in [45, 75] \nonumber \\
  Y/{\rm pc} &\in [320, 350] \nonumber \\
  Z/{\rm pc} &\in [40, 70] \nonumber \\
  v_b/{\rm km\,s^{-1}} &\in [-4, -3] \nonumber \\
  v_{l^*}/{\rm km\,s^{-1}} &\in [4, 6] \nonumber
\end{align}
For the diffuse stars near KOI-7368 and KOI-7913, we require
\begin{align}
  X/{\rm pc} &\in [20, 70] \nonumber \\
  Y/{\rm pc} &\in [230, 270] \nonumber \\
  Z/{\rm pc} &\in [75, 105] \nonumber \\
  v_b/{\rm km\,s^{-1}} &\in [-3.5, -1.5] \nonumber \\
  v_{l^*}/{\rm km\,s^{-1}} &\in [2, 6] \nonumber
\end{align}
and we call this latter set of stars ``CH-2''.  These cuts yield 141
candidate RSG-5 members, and 37 candidate CH-2 members.
Tables of these stars are enumerated in Appendix~\ref{app:members}.
An important consideration, especially for CH-2, is the
contamination rate by field stars.  We assess this in the following
section.

    beyond $\bpmrpo \gtrsim 2.6$.

\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Color-Absolute Magnitude Diagram}
\label{sec:camd}

Color-absolute magnitude diagrams (CAMDs) of the candidate RSG-5 and
CH-2 members are shown in the upper row of Figure~\ref{fig:age}.  The
stars from the $\delta$~Lyr cluster are from
\citet{bouma_kep1627_2022}, and the field stars are from the Gaia EDR3
Catalog of Nearby Stars \citep{gaia_gcns_2021}.  To make these
diagrams, we imposed the data filtering criteria from
\citet[][Appendix B]{GaiaCollaboration2018}, which 
include binaries while omitting instrumental artifacts from for
instance low photometric signal to noise, or a small number of
visibility periods.  We then corrected for extinction using the
\citet{lallement_threedimensional_2018}
dust maps\footnote{\url{https://stilism.obspm.fr/}} and the extinction coefficients $k_X\equiv A_X/A_0$ from
\citet{GaiaCollaboration2018}, assuming that $A_0 = 3.1 E(B-V)$.  This
yielded a mean and standard deviation for the reddening of
$E(B-V)=0.036\pm0.002$ for RSG-5, and $E(B-V)=0.017\pm0.001$
for CH-2.  By way of comparison, in \citet{bouma_kep1627_2022} the
same query for the $\delta$~Lyr cluster yielded
$E(B-V)=0.032\pm0.006$.  Finally, for the plots we set the
color range to best visualize the region of maximal age information
content: the pre-main-sequence.

The CAMDs show that for RSG-5, nearly all of our candidate members are
on a tight pre-main-sequence locus.  This implies a false positive
rate of a few percent, at most.  By comparison, our control sample
(the $\delta$~Lyr candidates) has a false positive rate of
$\approx$12\%, based on the number of stars that photometrically
overlap with the field population, while being outliers from the bulk cluster
population.  For CH-2, our membership selection gives 27 objects in
the color range displayed, and 23 of them appear to be consistent with
being on the pre-main-sequence.  This implies a false positive rate in
CH-2 of $\approx$15\%.

Figure~\ref{fig:age} also shows that most RSG-5 and
CH-2 members overlap with the $\delta$~Lyr cluster, and that the groups are therefore
roughly the same age.  To quantify this, we use the method
introduced by \citet[][their Section~6.3]{gagne_mutau_2020}.  The
idea is to fit the pre-main-sequence loci of a set of
reference clusters, and to then model the locus of the target cluster
as a linear combination of these reference cluster loci.  For our
reference clusters, we used UCL, IC\,2602, and the Pleiades, with the
memberships reported by \citet{Damiani2019} and
\cite{CantatGaudin2018a} respectively.  We adopted ages of 16\,Myr for
UCL \citep{pecaut_star_2016}, 38\,Myr for IC\,2602\footnote{ Ages for
IC\,2602 vary from 40 to 46\,Myr based on lithium-depletion-boundary
(LDB) measurements \citep{dobbie_ic_2010,randich_gaiaeso_2018}, and
from 30 to 46\,Myr based on isochronal analyses
\citep{stauffer_rotational_1997,david_ages_2015,bossini_age_2019}.},
and 112\,Myr for the Pleiades \citep{dahm_2015}.  These assumptions
and the subsequent processing steps taken to exclude field stars and binaries
were identical to those
described in \citet{bouma_kep1627_2022}.  The mean and 
uncertainty of the resulting age posterior are $46^{+9}_{-7}$\,Myr for
RSG-5, and $36^{+10}_{-8}$\,Myr for CH-2.  For comparison, this
procedure yields an age for the $\delta$~Lyr cluster of
$38^{+6}_{-5}$\,Myr.  
The slightly older isochronal age of RSG-5 is
consistent with its location
relative to the $\delta$~Lyr cluster in
the upper left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:age}.


\subsubsection{Stellar Rotation Periods}
\label{sec:rotation}

An independent way to assess the age of the candidate cluster members
is to measure their stellar rotation periods.  This approach can be
achieved using surveys such as TESS \citep{ricker_transiting_2015} and
the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF, \citealt{bellm_zwicky_2019});
it leverages a storied tradition of measuring rotation periods of stars in
benchmark open clusters \citep[see {\it
e.g.},][]{skumanich_time_1972,curtis_rup147_2020}.  The TESS data in
our case are especially useful, since they provide 3 to 5 lunar months
of photometry for all of our candidate CH-2 and RSG-5 members.

We selected stars suitable for gyrochronology by requiring $\bpmrpo
\geq 0.5$ to focus on FGKM stars that experience magnetic braking.
For TESS, we also restricted our sample to $G<16$, to ensure the stars
are bright enough to extract usable light curves from the full-frame
images.  The magnitude cut corresponds to $\bpmrpo < 2.6$
($\sim$M3V) at the relevant distances.  These cuts gave 19 stars in
CH-2 and 42 stars in RSG-5.  We extracted light curves from the TESS
images using the \texttt{unpopular} package
\citep{hattorio_2021_cpm}, and regressed them against systematics with
its causal pixel model.  We measured rotation periods using
Lomb-Scargle periodograms and visually vetted the results using an
interactive program that allows us to switch between TESS Cycles,
select particular sectors, flag stars with multiple periods, and
correct half-period harmonics. For ZTF, we used the same color cut to
focus on FGKM stars, but restricted the sample to $13 < G < 18$ to
avoid the saturation limit on the bright end and ensure sufficient
photometric precision at the faint end. We followed the procedure
outlined in \citet{curtis_rup147_2020}: we downloaded $8'\times8'$
image cutouts, ran aperture photometry for the target and neighboring
stars identified with Gaia, and used them to define a systematics
correction to refine the target light curves. 

The lower panels of Figure~\ref{fig:age} show the results.  In RSG-5,
36/42 stars have rotation periods faster than the Pleiades (86\%).
This numerator omits the two stars with periods $>$$12$\,days visible in
the lower-left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:age}.  The age interpretation
for these latter stars, particularly the $\approx$M2.5 dwarf, is not
obvious.  \citet{rebull_usco_2018} for instance have found numerous
M-dwarfs with 10-12 day rotation periods at ages of USco ($\sim$$8$\,Myr),
and some may still exist at ages of LCC ($\sim$$16$\,Myr;
L.~Rebull in preparation).  Regardless, given that nearly no field
star outliers seem to be present on the RSG-5 CAMD, the fact that we
do not detect rotation periods for $\approx$14\% of stars should
perhaps be taken as an indication for the fraction of stars for
which rotation periods might not be detectable, due to {\it e.g.}, pole-on
stars having lower amplitude starspot modulation.

For CH-2, 13/19 stars have rotation periods that are obviously faster
than their counterparts in the Pleiades (68\%).  4 stars, not included
in the preceding numerator, are M-dwarfs with rotation periods between
10 and 12.5 days.  As just discussed, the age interpretation for these
M-dwarfs is not obvious.  Regardless, the $\approx$15\% false positive
rate for CH-2 determined from the CAMD seems consistent with our
fraction of detected rotation periods; RSG-5 was missing
rotation periods for $\approx$15\% of its candidate members, even
though all of its stars appear photometrically consistent with being
on a single pre-main-sequence locus.

It is challenging to convert these stellar rotation periods to a
precise age estimate, since on the pre-main-sequence the stars are
spinning up due to thermal contraction rather than down due to
magnetized braking.  Regardless, the rotation period distributions of
both CH-2 and RSG-5 seem consistent with other 30\,Myr to 50\,Myr
clusters ({\it e.g.}, IC\,2602 and IC\,2391;
\citealt{douglas_stephanie_t_2021_5131306}).  They also seem
consistent with the false positive rates estimated from the
color-absolute magnitude diagrams.


\section{The Stars}
\label{sec:stars}

\input{tab_sysparams.tex}

A few salient properties of the Kepler objects in Cep-Her can be
gleaned from Figure~\ref{fig:age}.  The stars span spectral types of
G8V (Kepler-1627) to K6V (KOI-7913 A).  The secondary in the KOI-7913
system has spectral type $\approx$K8V.  And given that a Solar-mass
star with solar metallicity arrives at the zero-age main sequence at
$t\approx40$ Myr \citep{choi_mesa_2016}, these stars are all in the
late stages of their pre-main-sequence contraction.  
% Their heliocentric distances are $\approx$260\,pc (KOI-7913 and
% KOI-7368, in CH-2) and $\approx$340\,pc (Kepler-1643, in RSG-5).

The adopted stellar parameters are listed in
Table~\ref{tab:sysparams}.  The stellar surface gravity, radius, mass,
and density are found by interpolating against the MIST isochrones
\citep{choi_mesa_2016}.  The statistical uncertainties from this
technique mostly originate from the parallax uncertaintes; the
systematic uncertainties are taken to be the absolute difference
between the PARSEC \citep{bressan_parsec_2012} and MIST isochrones.
Reported uncertainties are a quadrature sum of the statistical and
systematic components. 

To verify these parameters and to also analyze spectroscopic youth
proxies such as the Li 6708\,\AA\ doublet and H$\alpha$,
we acquired spectra.  We also acquired high resolution imaging for
each system, to constrain the existence of visual companions,
including possible bound binaries.  The system-by-system details
follow, and the relevant results are also summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:sysparams}.

\subsection{Kepler\,1643}

\paragraph{Spectra}
For Kepler-1643, we acquired two iodine-free spectra from Keck/HIRES
on the nights of 2020 Aug 16 and 2021 Oct 25.  The acquisition and
analysis followed the usual techniques of the California Planet Survey
\citep{howard_cps_2010}.  We derived the stellar parameters ($T_{\rm
eff}, \log g, R_\star$) using \texttt{SpecMatch-Emp}
\citep{yee_SM_2017}, which yielded values in $<$$1$-$\sigma$ agreement
with those from the cluster-isochrone method.  This approach also
yielded $[{\rm Fe/H}]=0.13 \pm 0.09$.  Using the broadened synthetic
templates from \texttt{SpecMatch-Synth} \citep{petigura_cksi_2017}, we
found $v\sin i = 9.3 \pm 1.0\,\mkms$.  The systemic radial velocity at
the two epochs was $-9.1 \pm 1.9\,\mkms$ and $-7.8\pm
1.2\,\mkms$ respectively.  To infer the equivalent width of the
Li\,\textsc{I} 6708\,\AA\ doublet, we followed the procedure described
by \citet{bouma_2021_ngc2516}.  This yielded a strong detection: ${\rm
EW}_{\rm Li} = 130^{+6}_{-5}$\,m\AA, with values consistent at
$<$$1$-$\sigma$ between the two epochs.   The quoted value does not
correct for the Fe\,\textsc{I} blend at 6707.44\AA, because HIRES
resolves the two features.  
Given the purported age and effective temperature of the star, the
lithium equivalent width is somewhat low.  We discuss this in greater
depth in Appendix~\ref{app:spectra}.

\paragraph{High-Resolution Imaging}
We acquired adaptive optics imaging of Kepler-1643 on the night of
2019 June 28 using the NIRC2 imager on Keck-II.  Using the narrow
camera (FOV = 10.2\arcsec), we obtained 4 images in the $K'$ filter
($\lambda = 2.12\,\mu$m) with a total exposure time of 320\,s. We
analyzed these data following \citet{kraus_impact_2016}, and
determined the detection limits to visual companions by analyzing the
residuals after subtracting an empirical PSF template.  This procedure
yielded contrast limits of $\Delta K' = 4.1$ mag at $\rho = 150$ mas,
$\Delta K' = 5.8$ mag at $\rho = 300$ mas, and $\Delta K' = 8.3$ mag
at $\rho > 1000$ mas.


\subsection{KOI-7368}
\paragraph{Spectra}
For KOI-7368, we acquired a spectrum on 2015 June 1 using the echelle
spectrograph (TRES; \citealt{furesz_tres_2008}) mounted at the
Tillinghast 1.5m at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory.  The
stellar parameter classification pipeline for TRES has
been described by \citet{2021tsc2.confE.124B}.  It is based on the
synthetic template library constructed by
\citet{buchhave_hatp16b_class_2010}.  The resulting stellar parameters
($T_{\rm eff}, \log g, R_\star$) agreed with those from the
cluster-isochrone method within $1$-$\sigma$, though the effective
temperature was more precise by a factor of three.  Auxiliary
spectroscopic parameters included the metallicity $[{\rm Fe/H}]= -0.02
\pm 0.08$, the equatorial velocity $v\sin i = 20.21 \pm 0.50\,\mkms$,
and the systemic velocity ${\rm RV}_{\rm sys} = -10.9 \pm 0.2\,\mkms$.
The Li 6708\AA\ EW measurement procedure yielded ${\rm EW}_{\rm Li} =
236^{+16}_{-14}$\,m\AA.

\paragraph{High-Resolution Imaging}
We acquired adaptive optics imaging of KOI-7368 on the night of 2019
June 12, again using NIRC2.  The observational configuration and
reduction were identical as for Kepler-1643.  No companions were
detected, and the analysis of the image residuals yielded contrast
limits of $\Delta K' = 5.2$ mag at $\rho = 150$ mas, $\Delta K' = 6.7$
mag at $\rho = 300$ mas, and $\Delta K' = 8.7$ mag at $\rho > 1000$
mas.

\subsection{KOI-7913}

\paragraph{Binarity}
KOI-7913 is almost certainly a binary.  The north-west primary is
$\approx$0.5 magnitudes brighter than the south-east secondary in
optical passbands.  The two stars are separated in Gaia EDR3 by
$3\farcs5$ on-sky, and have parallaxes consistent within $1$-$\sigma$
(with an average $\varpi=3.66 \pm 0.01$\,mas).  The apparent on-sky
separation is $959 \pm 2$ au.  The Gaia EDR3 proper motions are also
nearly identical.  Since two stars were resolved in the Kepler Input
Catalog and are roughly one Kepler pixel apart, an accurate crowding
metric has already been applied in the NASA Ames data products to
correct the mean flux level \citep{2017ksci.rept....6M}.  This is
important for deriving accurate transit depths.

\paragraph{Spectra}
We acquired Keck/HIRES spectra for KOI-7913 A on the night of 2021 Nov
13, and KOI-7913 B on the night of 2021 Oct 26.  The
\texttt{SpecMatch-Emp} machinery yielded $T_{\rm
eff,A} = 4324 \pm 70\,{\rm K}$, and $T_{\rm eff,B} = 4038 \pm 70\,{\rm
K}$.  The remaining parameters were in agreement with those from the
cluster isochrone.  For the primary, we also found $[{\rm Fe/H}]=
-0.06 \pm 0.09$, $v\sin i = 13.3 \pm 1.0\,\mkms$, and ${\rm RV}_{\rm
sys} = -17.8 \pm 1.1\,\mkms$.  For the secondary, these same
parameters were $[{\rm Fe/H}]= -0.01 \pm 0.09$, $v\sin i = 10.7 \pm
1.0\,\mkms$, and ${\rm RV}_{\rm sys} = -18.8 \pm 1.1\,\mkms$.  Neither
of the KOI-7913 components shows strong lithium absorption, but this
is expected given their $\approx$K6V and $\approx$K8V spectral types.
They do however both show H$\alpha$ in emission.  Broadly speaking,
both observations are consistent with a $\approx$40 Myr age for
KOI-7913 (see Appendix~\ref{app:spectra}).


\paragraph{High-Resolution Imaging}
We acquired adaptive optics imaging of KOI-7913 on the night of 2020
Aug 27 using the NIRC2 imager.  The observational configuration and
reduction were identical as before.  The images showed KOI-7913 A,
KOI-7913 B, and an additional faint star $\approx$$0\farcs99$ due East
of KOI-7913 B.  Applying the PSF-fitting routines from
\citet{kraus_impact_2016}, the tertiary star has a separation $\rho =
4397 \pm 3$\,mas from the primary, at a position angle $231.17^\circ
\pm 0.02^\circ$, with $\Delta K' = 6.97 \pm 0.04$.  While it is too
faint to affect the interpretation of the KOI itself, it would be
amusing if the faint neighbor were also comoving and young -- at the
age of the system, it would have a mass roughly between 10 and
15\,M$_{\rm Jup}$.  Additional imaging epochs will tell.

\subsection{Kepler Data}

The Kepler space telescope observed Kepler-1643, KOI-7913, and
KOI-7368 at a 30-minute cadence between May 2009 and April 2013.  For
all three systems quarters 1 through 17 were observed with minimal
data gaps.  The top panel of Figure~\ref{fig:planets} shows a 50-day
slice of the \texttt{PDCSAP} light curves for the three new Cep-Her
candidates, along with Kepler-1627.  In \texttt{PDCSAP},
nonastrophysical variability is removed through a cotrending approach
that uses a set of basis vectors derived by applying singular value
decomposition to a set of systematics-dominated light curves
\citep{smith_kepler_PDC_2017}.  In our analysis, we used the
\texttt{PDCSAP} light curves with the default optimal aperture
\citep{smith_finding_2016}.  Cadences with non-zero quality flags were
omitted.  In all cases, the stars are dominated by spot-induced
modulation with peak-to-peak variability between 2\% and 10\%.  These
signals are much larger than the transits, which have depth
$\approx$0.1\%.  To quantify the stellar rotation periods, we
calculated the Lomb-Scargle periodogram for each Kepler quarter
independently.  The resulting means and standard deviations are in
Table~\ref{tab:sysparams}.


\subsection{Transit and Stellar Variability Model}
\label{sec:fitting}

Our goals in fitting the Kepler light curves are twofold.  First, we
want to derive accurate planetary sizes and orbital properties.
Second, we want to remove the stellar variability signal to enable a
statistical assessment of the probability that the transit signals are
planetary.

We fitted the data as follows.  Given an initial guess for the transit
ephemeris from \citet{thompson_planetary_2018}, we first trimmed the
light curve to a local window around each transit that spanned three
transit durations before and after each mid-transit time.  The
out-of-transit points in each local window were then fitted with a
fourth-order polynomial, which was divided out from the light
curve.  The resulting flattened transits were then fitted with a
transit model that assumed quadratic limb darkening.
The model therefore included 8 free parameters for the transit ($\{P,
t_0, \log R_{\rm p}/R_\star, b, u_1 ,u_2, R_\star, \log g\}$), 2 free
parameters for the light curve normalization and a white noise jitter
($\{\langle f \rangle, \sigma_f \}$), and 5 fixed
parameters for each transit.

We fitted the models using \texttt{exoplanet}
\citep{exoplanet:exoplanet}.  We assumed a Gaussian likelihood, and
sampled using \texttt{PyMC3}'s No-U-Turn Sampler
\citep{hoffman_no-u-turn_2014}, after having initialized to the the
maximum {\it a posteriori} (MAP) model.  We used the
\citet{gelman_inference_1992} statistic ($\hat{R}$) as our convergence
diagnostic.  The resulting fits are shown in the lower panels of
Figure~\ref{fig:planets}, and the important derived parameters are in
Table~\ref{tab:sysparams}.  The set of full parameters with their
priors are given in Appendix~\ref{app:transit}.

One drawback of our approach is that we have fixed 5 implicit
parameters per individual transit to their MAP values to remove the
starspot-induced variability.  An alternative could be to fit the
planetary transits simultaneously with the starspot-induced
variability using a quasiperiodic Gaussian process (GP).  We
explored this approach, but found that it sometimes required fine-tuning
of the hyperparameter priors, otherwise the GP would 
overfit flares, instrumental noise, and any other variability that was not
part of the transit.  This failure mode is pernicious, in that it yields an
ill-founded sense of confidence in a visually clean
fit.  Our model is simpler, and it has the benefit that the white
noise jitter never trades off with any parameter equivalent to a
damping timescale for the coherence of the GP.  It is also
computationally efficient, and it captures the planetary parameters
about which we care the most.


\subsection{Planet Validation}

In the future, it may be possible to obtain independent evidence for
the Cep-Her planets to directly confirm their planetary nature, for
instance through transit observations using a high-resolution
spectrograph.  For now, it is of interest whether the transit signals
might be astrophysical false positives, or whether they can be argued
to be planetary on a statistical basis.  We adopt the Bayesian
framework implemented in \texttt{VESPA} to assess the relevant
probabilities \citep{morton_efficient_2012,vespa_2015}.  Briefly
summarized, the priors in \texttt{VESPA} assume the binary star
occurrence rate from \citet{raghavan_survey_2010}, direction-specific
star counts from \citet{girardi_star_2005}, and planet occurrence
rates as described by \citet[][Section~3.4]{morton_efficient_2012}.
The likelihoods are then evaluated by forward-modeling a synthetic
population of eclipsing bodies for each astrophysical model class, in
which each population member has a known trapezoidal eclipse depth,
total duration, and ingress duration.  These summary statistics are
then compared against the actual photometric data to evaluate the
probabilities of false positive scenarios such as foreground eclipsing
binaries, hierarchical eclipsing binaries, and background eclipsing
binaries.

\paragraph{Kepler-1643}
Kepler-1643~b (KOI-6186.01) was already validated as a transiting
planet by \citet{morton_false_2016}, who found a probability for any
of the aforementioned false positive scenarios of 9$\times$10$^{-6}$.
Repeating the calculation with our own stellar-variability correction
and the new NIRC2 imaging constraints, we find ${\rm FPP} =
6\times10^{-9}$.  Figure~\ref{fig:planets} shows the justification:
the transit is flat and has a high S/N ($\approx 47$).  The shape is
therefore nearly impossible to reproduce with eclipsing binary models.

Intriguingly, Kepler-1643 formally failed one of the data validation
centroid shift tests (see the \texttt{q1\_q17\_dr25\_koi} data
release): the angular distance between the target star's catalog
position and the position of the transiting source was measured as
$1\farcs0$ at 4.4-$\sigma$.  The reports show however that two
outlying quarters (2 and 6) drive the offset -- the centroid locations
from the other Kepler quarters are consistent at $\lesssim 0\farcs4$.
Nonetheless, this is an instructive exercise in how stellar
variability complicates centroid-based vetting tests.  The centroid
shifts measured by these tests are determined from the in- and
out-of-transit flux-weighted centroids.  For stars with significant
spot-induced variability there is no static baseline in either the in-
or out-of-transit phases.

\paragraph{KOI-7368}
KOI-7368.01 is listed on the NASA Exoplanet Archive as a ``candidate''
planet.  \citet{morton_false_2016} did not compute a false positive
probability for the system because their default trapezoidal fitting
routine failed, presumably due to the spot-induced variability.  Our
fitting approach rectifies this point, and our new NIRC2 images
revealed no new stellar companions.  Performing the relevant
calculation, we find ${\rm FPP} \approx 4\times10^{-3}$.  Though not
as convincing as Kepler-1643, this formally clears the usual threshold
for calling the planet statistically validated
\citep{morton_efficient_2012}.  The S/N of the transit is
$\approx$$32$, which indicates that it is unlikely to be caused by
systematic noise in the light curve (see Figure~\ref{fig:planets}).
The positional probability score also meets the requirements for
transiting sources thought to share positions with their target stars
\citep{2017ksci.rept...16B}. 

It bears mentioning that KOI-7368 shows a weak centroid shift in the
\texttt{q1\_q17\_dr25\_koi} validation reports, similar to
Kepler-1643.  For KOI-7368, the reported offset is smaller, and less
statistically significant ($0\farcs2$; 3.0-$\sigma$).  Again, the data
validation reports show that the shift is caused by a few outlying
quarters (4, 5, 8, and 12).  The fact that the remaining data show a
consistent scatter between centroid locations suggests that these
outliers are also caused by the stellar variability.  Independently,
our NIRC2 imaging shows that there are no neighboring sources that
could cause an offset of the observed amplitude.

\paragraph{KOI-7913}
KOI-7913.01 is also currently listed on the NASA Exoplanet Archive as a
``candidate'' planet.  The canonical \citet{morton_false_2016}
analysis was of Q1-Q17 KOIs from DR24, and therefore spanned KOI-1.01
to KOI-7620.01 and omitted KOI-7913.01.  However the results of the
subsequent DR25 analysis by Morton et al.\ are listed at the NASA
Exoplanet Archive.  The relevant table gives a probability for the
system being an astrophysical false positive of $1.4\times10^{-4}$,
with the most likely false positive scenario being a blended eclipsing
binary.  Repeating the calculation with our new detrending and
contrast curves, we find a similar result: ${\rm FPP} =
1.3\times10^{-4}$.  Though the transit has the lowest S/N of any of
the objects discusssed (${\rm S/N}=14$), its lower FPP relative to
KOI-7368 can be understood through its relatively flat-bottomed shape,
combined with its long transit duration relative to plausible
eclipsing binary models (Figure~\ref{fig:planets}).  The host star
probability usability score \citep{2017ksci.rept...16B} also meets the
usual threshold, and so the planet seems to be validated.  Its
disposition has however previously fluctuated from ``false positive''
to ``candidate''.  The most likely explanation is the presence of
KOI-7913~B, which is located approximately one Kepler pixel away from
Kepler-7913 A (see Appendix~\ref{app:koi7913}).  Our pixel-level
analysis of the target pixel files did not show any evidence to
support the idea that KOI-7913~B could host the transiting planet.
Our NIRC2 imaging similarly ruled out the possibility of any other
plausible host star for the planet other than KOI-7913~A.

\subsection{Normal-Sized Mini-Neptunes Exist at 40$\,$Myr}
\label{subsec:sizes}

The most significant novelty about
Kepler-1643~b, KOI-7368.01, and KOI-7913~Ab is that their sizes are
normal, relative to the known population of gigayear-old
mini-Neptunes.  At field star ages, mini-Neptune sizes span
1.8\,$R_\oplus$ to 3.6\,$R_\oplus$, with the most
common size being $\approx 2.4\,R_\oplus$
\citep[][Figure~7]{Fulton_et_al_2017}.  The known planets younger than
$10^8$ years are almost all larger, with sizes between 4 and
10$\,R_\oplus$
\citep{Mann_K2_33b_2016,David_et_al_2017,benatti_possibly_2019,david_four_2019,newton_tess_2019,rizzuto_tess_2020,bouma_cluster_2020,mann_toi1227_2022}.
Figure~\ref{fig:rp_period_age} explores this in more detail by showing
the sizes, orbital periods, and ages of the known transiting planets,
emphasizing planets with precise ages.  The smallest previously known planets
comparable to the new Cep-Her mini-Neptunes
are AU~Mic~c ($3.0\pm0.2\,R_\oplus$, see
\citealt{martioli_aumicbc_2021} and \citealt{gilbert_flares_2022}),
Kepler-1627~Ab ($3.8\pm0.2\,R_\oplus$; \citealt{bouma_kep1627_2022}),
and AU~Mic~d ($4.2\pm0.2\,R_\oplus$; \citealt{plavchan_planet_2020}).

The theoretical expectation is that mini-Neptunes with sizes of 2 to
3\,$R_\oplus$ should be common at ages of $10^7$ to $10^8$ years.
This expectation is tied to inferences about the
initial distributions of planetary core mass, core composition, and
atmospheric mass fraction \citep{owen_evaporation_2017}.  The
Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling timescale, which is tied to the entropy of
the planetary interior once the disk disperses, could also play a
significant role \citep{owen_constraining_2020}.  As an example,
\citet{rogers_unveiling_2021} predicted that given a core-mass
distribution peaked at $\approx$$4$\,$M_\oplus$, an ice-poor rock/iron
core composition, and a typical H/He mass fraction of $\approx$4\%,
there should be a maximum in planet occurrence at 2 to 3\,$R_\oplus$
at times between 10 and 100\,Myr
(their Figure~16).  The models advanced by
\citet{gupta_signatures_2020} and \citet{lee_primordial_2021} agree;
the theoretical differences lie in their explanations
for the radius valley.  If the radius gap is primordial
and created by gas accretion physics, then super-Earths
($<$$1.8$\,$R_\oplus$) would be common as early as $10^7$ years
\citep{lee_primordial_2021}.   The photoevaporation-driven models more
often quote $10^8$ year timescales for production of
atmosphere-stripped super-Earths, while the models with the mass-loss
driven by a slow escape of heat from the core predict longer
$\sim$$10^9$ year timescales (but see \citealt{king_euv_2020}).

Systems such as K2-25, V1298~Tau, HIP-67522, TOI-837,
and TOI-1227 have sizes that are much larger than the picture we have
just described.  However, their large sizes can be accommodated
by existing models by invoking any of {\it i)} larger core masses,
{\it ii)} more volatile-rich compositions, {\it iii)}  larger initial
atmospheric mass fractions, or {\it iv)} longer thermal cooling times.
For instance, perhaps all five of the the aforementioned systems are
large simply because the planets are more massive than most
mini-Neptunes.  Secure mass measurements would help constrain this
parameter space, but the $\sim$1\,\kms\ spot-induced radial velocity
semi-amplitudes makes measuring the Doppler orbits incredibly
challenging.  \citep[][]{cale_diving_2021,zicher_one_2022,klein_one_2022}.
Regardless, the new Kepler-1643, KOI-7368, and KOI-7913 systems do
demonstrate that at least some planets at 40\,Myr have sizes that are
consistent with theoretical expectations for mini-Neptunes.  While
selection effects imposed by spot-induced photometric variability are
a likely explanation for why planets this small have not previously
been identified \citep[{\it e.g.},][]{zhou_2021_tois}, future work
should quantify this bias more carefully, in order to enable empirical
studies of how the planetary size distribution changes at early times.


\subsection{Is CH-2 a real cluster?}
\label{subsec:ch2}

RSG-5, and Kepler-1643's membership inside it, meet typical
expectations for a star claimed to be in an open cluster.  RSG-5 is an
obvious overdensity relative to the local field, and our
membership selection easily produces a clean pre-main-sequence locus
in color versus absolute magnitude (Figure~\ref{fig:age}).  CH-2, and
KOI-7913 and KOI-7368's membership inside it, do not meet these
expectations in as obvious a manner.  This is because the CH-2
association is diffuse.

To quantify the density difference between CH-2 and RSG-5, we can compare the spatial and
velocity volumes searched for each group.
For RSG-5, we drew 141 candidate members from a $30\,{\rm
pc}\times30\,{\rm pc}\times30\,{\rm pc}$ spatial cube, given a $1 {\rm
\mkms} \times 2 {\rm \mkms }$ rectangle in apparent galactic velocity.
For CH-2, our 37 candidate members came from a rectangular prism of
dimension $50\,{\rm pc}\times40\,{\rm pc}\times30\,{\rm pc}$, and a
rectangular box of $2 {\rm \mkms} \times 4 {\rm \mkms}$.  If we define
the searched volume in units of ${\rm pc}^3\,{\rm km^2}\,{\rm s^{-2}}$, then
the volume ratio of CH-2 to RSG-5 is 9 to 1.  The number of candidate
members per unit searched volume in RSG-5 relative to CH-2 is
therefore 34 to 1.

Given its low density, in CH-2 really a star cluster?  For this
discussion, let us adopt the definition that a star cluster is a group
of at least 12 stars that was physically associated at its time of
formation.  The somewhat arbitrary ``12'' is set to distinguish star
clusters from high-order multiples \citep[see][]{krumholz_star_2019}.
Dissolved clusters and their tidal tails are therefore included in our
concept of clusters.  We do not require however that a particular number of stars per
unit spatial volume is required for a group to be a ``cluster''.
The latter point acknowledges that an important
factor in cluster identification is also the density in velocity
space.  Perhaps once stellar rotation periods and chemical abundances
reach the same level of ubiquity as stellar proper motions, they might
enable further refinement of our ability to discover stars that formed
together.

From a data-driven perspective, demonstrating that a group of stars
was physically associated at its time of formation is challenging.
While some young groups show kinematic evidence for expansion
\citep{kuhn_kinematics_2019}, many, including Sco-Cen, do not
\citep{wright_kinematics_2018}.  This complicates the feasibility of
deriving kinematic ages through traceback, as
well as through the expansion itself
\citep[see][]{crundall_chronostar_2019}.  A more minimal approach is
that suggested by \citet{tofflemire_2021}: search for coeval,
phase-space neighbors, measure their ages, and determine if they share
a common age.  This approach can demonstrate whether a star is {\it
currently associated} with a set of coeval stars, which is much easier
than determining what the association looked like in the past.  Our
analysis of CH-2 meets the latter standard for the existence of a
$\approx$40\,Myr assocation today.  It would be a worthy exercise for
future work to perform a similar search for coeval phase-space
neighbors on the entire dataset of known exoplanet hosts.  For the
time being, we can offer the anecdotal point that in our experience,
most stars do not have dozens of 40\,Myr neighbors within a
local volume of a few \kms\ and tens of parsecs.


\subsection{Future work}

\paragraph{Cep-Her}
Our analysis to date has focused only on portions of Cep-Her that were
observed by Kepler: RSG-5, CH-2, and the $\delta$~Lyr cluster.  The
membership and kinematics of the other subgroups shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:XYZvtang} deserve independent attention.  R.~Kerr and
collaborators have {\bf acquired N spectra} from which radial
velocities will be derived in their upcoming study, but if the
estimate that Cep-Her has $\approx$3{,}500 stars is correct then more
might be required to fully untangle the kinematics of the various
groups.  Wide-field spectroscopic surveys such as LAMOST
\citep{zhao_2012_LAMOST} or SDSS-V \citep{kollmeier_2017} could
provide sensitivity to the Li 6708\,\AA\ line, which would enable a
more detailed analysis of its abundance across the FGK members.  Gaia
DR3 may also provide RVS spectra for some of the brighter F and G
dwarfs, which would contain the calcium infrared triplet as another
age indicator.

A number of worthy photometric projects also seem possible given the
new understanding of the complex.  One is asteroseismology of the
$\delta$~Sct stars, using either TESS or Kepler data
\citep{bedding_very_2020}.  For cases in which the modes are resolved,
this might yield age estimates for subgroups independent from other
approaches.  Other projects could include searches of the Kepler light
curves for exocomets \citep{zieba_transiting_2019}, and for missed
planets around the most rapid rotators.

\paragraph{Exoplanet demographics at early times}
Our main motivation for finding new young planets is to help benchmark models
for planetary evolution.  However demographic analyses of the known planets
between $10^7$ and $10^9$ years have so far been somewhat limited.
Approximately 40 such planets are now known (Figure~\ref{fig:age}).  The
majority of published cases ($\approx$20) come from K2, though now $\approx$10
come from Kepler, and $\approx$10 from TESS.

Given the current state of the field, a few reflections regarding experimental
design of a demographic survey might be useful.  The first is that the list of
target stars with known ages is an essential ingredient.  The best way to
compile relevant stars right now is likely by combining automated
spatio-kinematic clustering from Gaia with rotation periods measured using TESS
\citep[see the appendices of][]{bouma_kep1627_2022}.  The second consideration
is that known young planets smaller than $3$\,$R_\oplus$ all come from either
K2 or Kepler.  Demographic inferences based on TESS are therefore limited to
sizes $\gtrsim4$\,$R_\oplus$, for planets close-in to their host stars.  It
seems worthwhile to compare the absolute occurrence rate of such planets to
those observed by Kepler.  One specific question that seems within reach would
be to clarify whether enough young stars have been searched for the dearth of
young hot Jupiters shown in Figure~\ref{fig:age} to be significant.  Since the
hot Jupiter occurrence rate is strongly dependent on stellar mass and
metallicity \citep{petigura_metallicity_2018,petigura_cksX_2022}, particular
care would be needed to select a sample of well-studied FGK dwarfs for the
measurement, likely including stars in Sco OB2, Cep-Her, and Orion.  For
demographic studies focused on how mini-Neptune sizes evolve, the combined K2
and Kepler dataset might be the better primary source.  



\subsection{Summary}

We have showed that Kepler-1643~b, KOI-7368~b, and KOI-7913~Ab
are 40 to 50 million years old, and that each system
is most likely planetary.  The evidence for the planetary
interpretation comes from an application of \texttt{VESPA} to the
Kepler data, alongside new imaging from NIRC2.  The
validity of the \texttt{VESPA} framework rests on the premise that
non-astrophysical false positives can be rejected.  Kepler-1643 and
KOI-7368 both pass all but one of the canonical vetting tests: the
check for centroid offsets between the in and out-of-transit phases.
For both cases, the weak observed shifts seem to be
caused by starspot-induced variability in specific quarters
spuriously moving the stellar center-of-light.
Independently, our imaging rules out companion stars at the brightness
and positions that would be needed to explain the reported shifts.

Each system has multiple indicators of youth that support the
reported ages.  For Kepler-1643, the strongest youth indicator
is its physical and kinematic association with RSG-5.  Based on the
color-absolute magnitude diagram, we are able to select members
of this cluster with a false positive rate of a few percent
(Figure~\ref{fig:age}).  Kepler-1643 is one such member.  While the stellar
rotation period period agrees with this assessment, the star's lithium
equivalent width is somewhat low, which might motivate future exploration
of lithium depletion across FGKM stars in RSG-5 (see Appendix~\ref{app:spectra})

The spatio-kinematic argument for the youth of KOI-7368 and
KOI-7913 is weaker because they are in an association of stars, CH-2,
that is more diffuse.  For KOI-7913, stronger indicators of its age
come from its binary.  Both stellar components in KOI-7913
have isochronal ages consistent with $40$\,Myr.
Both components also show H$\alpha$ in emission, which for
the $\approx$K6V primary is a strong indicator that the star is
$\lesssim$100$\,$Myr old.  KOI-7368 is slightly more
massive, and the Li 6708\,\AA\ measurement and stellar rotation period
provide independent verification of the
star's youth.

The astrophysical significance of these considerations
is that planets $\sim$2 Earth radii in size exist at ages of 40 million years.
It will be interesting to continue the push down to smaller planetary
sizes at comparable ages -- the planetary detections we have
presented are well above the average detection significance for Kepler 
planets.  There may still be room at the bottom.

\section{Table of Candidate RSG-5 and CH-2 Members}
\label{app:members}

{\bf LGB TODO: add Gaia source lists and abbreviated info.  Include rotation periods.}

% We measured rotation periods for 53 stars with ZTF and 51 stars with
% TESS, for a total of 71 periods reported for unique stars and 32
% overlapping between the surveys. We adopted the ZTF period over the
% TESS period in three cases: (1) Gaia EDR3 2081755809272821248: the
% Lomb-Scargle periodogram favored 6.67 days, consistent with the ZTF
% period of 6.61 days; however, we flagged it as a candidate
% double-dipper, which appears to have inaccurately doubled the TESS
% period to 13.34 days; (2) Gaia EDR3 2081737529891330560: we found 3.06
% days with TESS and 6.64 days with ZTF; we suspect that TESS captured
% the 1/2-period harmonic and adopt the approximately double value from
% ZTF; (3) 2134851775526125696: for this star, we measured 1.91 days
% with TESS from Cycle 2, but noted that the signal appeared to be
% missing in Cycle 4; ZTF found a strong signal at 12.23 days and we
% adopt this as the star's period. In the remaining overlap cases, we
% adopted the average between TESS and ZTF as the final period. For
% these overlap stars, the median absolute deviation is 0.01 days,
% showing remarkable consistency between the surveys. For three stars,
% we failed to detect a period in TESS but recovered one from ZTF; in
% all cases the periods appear to be 13--16 days, pushing the limit of
% what is detectable with TESS with our procedure: (1) Gaia EDR3
% 2129930258400157440, TESS showed a flat light curve while ZTF yielded
% a 15.3-day period; (2) Gaia EDR3 2082376861542398336, LS found a
% 7.6-day period which we rejected during visual validation; we found
% 15.4 days with ZTF, and we suspect that the weak/rejected singal form
% TESS might have been a 1/2 period harmonic; (3) Gaia EDR3
% 2082397099429013120, similar to the previous case, we rejected a
% 6.7-day signal from TESS and recovered a 12.8-day period with ZTF.

Figure~\ref{fig:koiyouthindicators} shows key portions of the HIRES

absorption is obvious at 6708\AA\ in all stars except KOI-7913 B,
where it is marginal.  H$\alpha$ is in emission for both components of
KOI-7913, and in absorption for the hotter stars.  In the following,
we compare these observations against stars in benchmark open

\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{fig:lithium} compares the measured lithium equivalent
widths of the Kepler objects against a few reference populations.  We
selected studies from the literature only where upper limits were
explicitly reported.  KOI-7368 and KOI-7913~A have secure lithium
detections, and the KOI-7913~B detection is marginal (${\rm EW}_{\rm
Li} = 42^{+12}_{-19}$).  For all three stars, as well as for
Kepler-1627~A, the observed lithium equivalent width is consistent
with the stellar effective temperatures and $\approx40$\,Myr ages.

Kepler-1643, in RSG-5, is conspicuously below the 40-50$\,$Myr
sequence in the left-panel of Figure~\ref{fig:lithium}, while still
being above the field stars (${\rm EW}_{\rm Li} = 130^{+6}_{-5}$).
The right panel shows the comparison against the Pleiades, where
Kepler-1643 is more consistent with the observed dispersion in
lithium.

One explanation for this could be that Kepler-1643 is a field
interloper; another could be that RSG-5 is older than 50\,Myr.  We do
not favor the former, given that {\it i)} the star was selected based
on its spatio-kinematic proximity to other RSG-5 members, nearly all
of which appear consistent with being $\approx$50\,Myr old
(Figure~\ref{fig:age} upper left), and {\it ii)} the same RSG-5
members display a gyrochronal sequence consistent with being younger
than the Pleaides (Figure~\ref{fig:age} lower left).  We do not have
an explanation, but in the following paragraph speculate on one
possible line of future work that might help resolve the discrepancy.

Analyzing Figure~\ref{fig:lithium}, it is remarkable that in just 50
million years, stars between $4500$\,K and $5200$\,K go from having
such a tight lithium sequence to one with a dispersion
$\approx10\times$ greater.  The existence of such a dispersion in
Pleiades-age K-dwarfs has been known for longer than some of the
present authors have been alive; it has also been known that the stars
with the most lithium are also the most rapidly rotating
\citep{butler_pleiades_1987,soderblom_evolution_1993}.  More recent
analyses of this correlation have been reviewed by
\citet{bouvier_lithium-rotation_2020}.  The conclusion of that work
was that the origin of the rotation-lithium correlation likely lies
within pre-main-sequence stellar physics.  If so, one would expect the
IC\,2062 and Tuc-Hor K-dwarfs to show a larger intrinsic lithium
dispersion, which they do not.  It seems therefore that the exact
onset time of the K-dwarf lithium dispersion might be worth
clarifying.  \citet{messina_rotation-lithium_2016} for instance do not
obviously see it in the $\beta$~Pic moving group ($25\pm3$\,Myr).
Given that RSG-5 seems somewhat isochronally older than the
$\delta$~Lyr cluster (and therefore IC\,2602
\citealt{bouma_kep1627_2022}), it might be a worthy cluster for such
an analysis.

\subsection{H$\alpha$}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:koiyouthindicators}, H$\alpha$ is in
emission for both components of KOI-7913, and in absorption for the
hotter stars.  Additionally, the emission appears double-peaked for
both of the KOI-7913 components.  We note that KOI-7913~A and
KOI-7913~B were spatially resolved from each other during data
acquisition.  Performing a cross-correlation between each of the stars
and the nearest matches in the Keck/HIRES template library, we also
found that the CCFs for both components of KOI-7913 showed no
indications of double-lined binarity \citep{kolbl_detection_2015}.

Balmer line emission, particularly for H$\alpha$, is expected for
stars of this age.  \citet{kraus_stellar_2014} for instance, in their
survey of Tuc-Hor ($\approx$40\,Myr), observed that essentially all
cluster members with spectral type $>$${\rm K4.5V}$ had H$\alpha$ in
emission.  The agrees with our observations that KOI-7913 shows
H$\alpha$ in emission for both components, while it is in absorption
for all of our other Kepler objects.  The double-peaked nature of the
emission, though not always present, is also not particularly rare for
active stars.  Proxima Centauri, for instance, has double-peaked
H$\alpha$ emission \citep{collins_calculations_2017}.  A simple
explanation is self-absorption: photons nearest the center of the line
see a greater optical depth from higher layers of the chromosphere,
while photons on the wings are on average too far from the
rest-wavelength to excite electrons and be re-absorbed in the upper
layers.  The exact details of when a star's atmosphere reaches the
conditions for such self-absorption require non-local thermal
equilibrium models of the chromosphere
\citep{short_chromospheric_1998,2005A&A...439.1137F}.

\section{Disposition History of KOI-7913}
\label{app:koi7913}

The disposition of KOI-7913.01 has been debated: in
\texttt{q1\_q17\_dr25\_koi} the source was flagged as a false
positive, with the comment ``cent\_kic\_pos---halo\_ghost''.  This
comment and disposition were removed in the
\texttt{q1\_q17\_dr25\_sup\_koi} data release, which renamed the
planet a ``candidate''.  In this note, we discuss the interpretation
of these flags (which do not apply to the system, according to the
latest analysis).  We also discuss how the relative locations of
KOI-7913~A and KOI-7913~B affect the interpretation of the Kepler
data.

As described by \citet{thompson_planetary_2018}, the
``cent\_kic\_pos'' flag is an indication that the measured source
centroid is offset from its expected location in the Kepler Input
Catalog.  The final Kepler data validation reports, generated 2016 Jan
30, do not show this to be the case for KOI-7913.  Moreover, the
statistical significance of any centroid offset is lower than for
KOI-7368 and Kepler-1643 (which both show centroid offsets that are
likely explained by the stellar variability).

What of the ``halo\_ghost'' flag?  This test measures the transit
strength for the pixels inside the aperture, and compares it to that
measured in the ring of pixels around said aperture (the ``halo'').
Generally one expects the transit signal to be strongest in the
central aperture, rather than the halo.  Two types of false positive
scenarios can change this and trigger the flag: the first is when
optical ghosts from bright eclipsing binaries reflect off the CCD, and
contaminate the target star.  The second is when the PRF of nearby
stars directly overlaps with the PRF of the target star (see
\citealt{thompson_planetary_2018}, Section A.5.2).  The most obvious
explanation for KOI-7913 is the latter case, given that KOI-7913 B is
$\approx0.9$ Kepler pixels away from Kepler-7913 A and so it usually
part of the ``halo''.  Due to the on-sky orientation of KOI-7913 A and
KOI-7913 B, the default ``optimal aperture'' selected in quarters 3,
7, 11, and 15 in fact included both stars, while for the remaining
quarters KOI-7913 B was excluded from the optimal aperture but was
included as part of the halo (see pages 35 through 71 of the data
validation reports.)  

Given the orientation of the stars and the $\approx$1.5 pixel FWHM of
the Kepler pixel response function, some blending between the two
stars is present.  The pointing geometries from quarters 3, 7, 11, and
15 however did not noticeably affect the observed transit depths,
which is an indication that the crowding metric applied in the data
products accurately correct the mean flux level
\citep{2017ksci.rept....6M}.  Analysis of the target-pixel data that
was acquired separately for KOI-7913~B also reveals a clearly
different stellar rotation period, and no hint of the transit signal.
