  Stellar positions and velocities from Gaia are yielding a new and
  refined view of how stellar clusters evolve.
  Here we present an analysis of a group of $\approx$40 million
  year old stars spanning Cepheus ($l=100^\circ$) to Hercules
  ($l=40^\circ$), hereafter the Cep-Her complex.  The group contains
  four known Kepler Objects of Interest:
  Kepler-1627 Ab ($R_{\rm p} = 3.85 \pm 0.11\,R_\oplus$, $P = 7.2\ {\rm days}$),
  Kepler-1643 b ($R_{\rm p} = 2.32 \pm 0.14\,R_\oplus$, $P = 5.3\ {\rm days}$),
  KOI-7368 b ($R_{\rm p} = 2.22 \pm 0.12\,R_\oplus$, $P = 6.8\ {\rm days}$), and
  KOI-7913 Ab ($R_{\rm p} = 2.34 \pm 0.18\,R_\oplus$, $P = 24.2\ {\rm days}$).
  Kepler-1627 is a Neptune-sized planet in a sub-component of the
  complex called the $\delta$\ Lyr\ cluster
  \citep{bouma_kep1627_2022}.  Here we focus on the latter three
  systems, which are in other sub-components of the complex (RSG-5 and
  CH-2).  Based on kinematic evidence from Gaia, stellar rotation
  periods from TESS, and spectroscopy, these three systems are also
  $38 \pm 6$ million years old.  Based on the transit shapes and high
  resolution imaging, they are all most
  likely planets (false positive probabilities of $6\times10^{-9}$,
  $5\times10^{-3}$, and $1\times10^{-4}$ for Kepler-1643, KOI-7368,
  and KOI-7913 respectively).  Kepler-1643 and KOI-7913 are therefore
  the first empirical demonstration that mini-Neptunes with sizes of
  $\approx$2 Earth radii exist at ages of roughly 40 million years.

\section{Introduction}

The discovery and characterization of transiting planets younger than
a billion years is a major frontier in current exoplanet research.
The reason is that the properties of young planets provide benchmarks
for studies of planetary evolution.  For instance, there are the
questions of when hot Jupiters arrive on their close-in orbits
\citep{dawson_johnson_2018}, how the sizes of planets with massive
gaseous envelopes evolve \citep{rizzuto_tess_2020}, when and if
close-in multiplanet systems fall out of resonance
\citep{arevalo_stability_2022,goldberg_architectures_2022},
and whether and how mass-loss explains the radius valley
\citep{lopez_how_2012,Owen_Wu_2013,Fulton_et_al_2017,ginzburg_corepowered_2018,lee_primordial_2021}.

The discovery of a young planet requires two claims to be fulfilled:
the planet must exist, and its age must be secured.  Spaced-based
photometry from K2 and TESS has yielded a number of young planets for
which the planetary evidence comes from transits, and the age evidence
is based on either cluster membership \citep[{\it
e.g.},]{Mann_et_al_2017,david_four_2019,newton_tess_2019,bouma_cluster_2020,nardiello_pathosII_2020}
or else on correlates of youth such as stellar rotation, photospheric
lithium abundances, x-ray activity, or emission line strength
\citep[{\it e.g.},]{zhou_2021_tois,hedges_toi-2076_2021}.

In this work, we leverage recent analyses of the Gaia data, which have
greatly expanded our knowledge of stellar group memberships
\citep[{\it e.g.},][]{CantatGaudin2018a,KounkelCovey2019,Kerr2021}.
Broadly speaking these analyses cluster on the stellar positions and
on-sky velocities measured by Gaia, with varying degrees of filtering
and supervision.  One important result is the identification of
diffuse streams and tidal tails comparable in stellar mass to the
previously known cores of many open clusters
\citep{meingast_psceri_2019,Meingast2021,gagne_number_2021}.  These
spatially diffuse groups typically have velocity dispersions of
$\sim$1\kms, and can be verified to be ``co-eval'' through analyses of
color-absolute magnitude diagrams, stellar rotation periods
\citep{curtis_tess_2019,bouma_2021_ngc2516}, and chemical abundances
\citep{hawkins_2020}.  While there are many implications for our
understanding of star formation and cluster evolution \citep[{\it
e.g.}][]{dinnbier_tidal_2020}, a more immediate consequence is that we
now know the ages of many more stars, including previously known
planet hosts.

%Assuming a constant star formation rate in the Galaxy, $\approx$1\% of
%stars are $\lesssim$10$^8$ years old.  While $\approx$5{,}000
%transiting exoplanets are known (CITE), 11 currently meet this age
%cut.  The discrepancy between the $\approx$50 expected and $\approx$10
%known likely has a contribution from selection effects in planetary
%detection, which include photometric and spectroscopic starspot
%modulation, and the rarity of young stars.

% While detecting planets around young and active stars is challenging,
% so is measuring stellar ages (see CITE Soderblom for a review).  It
% should therefore not be surprising that advances along either
% dimension can yield advances in the census of young transiting
% planets.

The prime Kepler mission \citep{borucki_kepler_2010} found most of the
currently known transiting exoplanets, and it was conducted before
Gaia.  It therefore seems sensible to revisit the Kepler field, given
our new knowlege of the stellar ages.

In this work, we expand on our previous study of a $38^{+7}_{-6}$
million year old Neptune-sized planet in the Kepler field (Kepler-1627
Ab; \citealt{bouma_kep1627_2022}).  The age of this planet was derived
based on its host star's membership in the $\delta$\ Lyr\ cluster.
Our analysis of the cluster focused on the immediate spatial and
kinematic vicinity of Kepler-1627~A in order to reliably confirm the
age of the planet.  However it became clear that the $\delta$\ Lyr\
cluster seems to also be part of a much larger group of similarly aged
stars.  This group, which is at a distance of $\approx$300 parsecs
from the Sun, appears to span Cepheus to Hercules (galactic
longitudes, $l$, between 40$^\circ$ and 100$^\circ$), with galactic
latitudes spanning roughly 0 and 20 degrees.  We therefore refer to it
as the Cep-Her complex.  It exhibits significant sub-structure over
its $\approx$250 parsec length, and a detailed analysis that delves
into the memberships, kinematics, and possible origin of the group is
currently being prepared by R.~Kerr and collaborators.

Here, our focus is on the intersection of the Cep-Her complex with the
Kepler field.  Cross-matching the full set of candidate Cep-Her
members against known Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs)
\citep{thompson_planetary_2018} yielded four candidate cluster
members: Kepler-1627, Kepler-1643, KOI-7368, and KOI-7913.  Given our
previous analysis of Kepler-1627, we will mostly focus on the latter
three.  After analyzing the relevant properties of Cep-Her
(Section~\ref{sec:cluster}), we discuss the stellar properties
(Section~\ref{sec:stars}) and validate the planetary nature of each
system using a combination of the Kepler photometry and
high-resolution imaging (Section~\ref{sec:planets}).  We conclude with
a discussion of implications for the size-evolution of close-in
mini-Neptunes (Section~\ref{sec:disc}).

  local population of candidate young stars around KOI-7368 and
  KOI-7913 is more diffuse -- we call this region ``CH-2''.

\subsection{Previous Related Work}

Our focus is on a region of the Galaxy approximately 200 to 500
parsecs from the Sun, above the galactic plane, and spanning galactic
longitudes of roughly $40^\circ$ to $100^\circ$ degrees.  Two rich
clusters in this region are the $\delta$~Lyra cluster
\citep{stephenson_possible_1959} and RSG-5 \citep{roser_nine_2016}.
Both of these clusters were known before Gaia, and have reported ages
between $\approx$30 and $\approx$60 million years.  Early empirical
evidence that these two clusters are likely part of a large and more
diffuse population was apparent in the Gaia-based photometric analysis
of pre-main-sequence stars by \citet[][see their Figures~11
and~13]{Zari2018}.  Further kinematic connections and complexity were
highlighted by \citet{KounkelCovey2019}, who included these previously
known groups in the larger structures dubbed ``Theia~73'' and
``Theia~96''\footnote{A useful visualization is available online at
\url{http://mkounkel.com/mw3d/mw2d.html} (accessed 15 March 2022)}.
The connection made by \citet{KounkelCovey2019} between the previously
known open clusters and the other groups in the region was made as
part of an unsupervised clustering analysis of the Gaia DR2 positions
and tangential velocities with a subsequent manual ``stitching'' step,
and generally supports the idea that there is an overdensity of
$30$--$60\,{\rm Myr}$ old stars in this region of the Galaxy.
\citet{Kerr2021}, in a volume-limited analysis of the Gaia DR2
point-source catalog out to one third of a kiloparsec, identified
three of the nearest sub-populations, dubbed ``Cepheus-Cygnus'',
``Lyra'', and ``Cerberus''.  \citet{Kerr2021} reported ages for each
of these subgroups between 30 and 35 million years.


\subsection{Member Selection}
\label{subsec:members}

The possibility that the $\delta$~Lyr cluster, RSG-5, and a few nearby
sub-populations in this quadrant of the sky share a common origin has
yet to be fully substantiated, and will be the subject of an upcoming
study by R.~Kerr and collaborators.  Our primary interest in the
region stems from the fact that a portion of it was observed by Kepler
(Figure~\ref{fig:XYZvtang}, top panel).  To further explore the
population of $10$--$100\,{\rm Myr}$ stars that were observed, we
select candidate Cep-Her members through four steps, the first three
being identical to those described in Section~3 of \citet{Kerr2021}.
We briefly summarize them here.

{\bf TODO RONAN: PLEASE VET ENTIRE SECTION, AND UPDATE WHERE
APPROPRIATE!}.

The first step is to select stars that are photometrically distinct
from the field star population based on Gaia EDR3 magnitudes $\{G,
G_{\rm RP}, G_{\rm BP}\}$, parallaxes and auxiliary reddening
estimates \citep{lallement_gaia-2mass_2019}.  This step yielded \npms\
stars with high-quality photometric and astrometry, which are either
pre-main-sequence K and M dwarfs due to their long contraction
timescales, or massive stars near the zero-age main sequence due to
their rapid evolutionary timescales.

The second step is to then perform in an unsupervised HDBScan
clustering on the photometrically selected population
\citep{campello_hierarchical_2015,mcinnes_hdbscan_2017}.  The
parameters we use in this clustering analysis are $\{ X, Y, Z, c v_b,
c v_{l^*} \} $, where $c$ is the size-velocity corrective factor,
which is taken as $c=6\,{\rm pc / km\,s}^{-1}$ to ensure that the
spatial and velocity scales have identical standard deviations.
Positions are computed assuming the \texttt{astropy v4.0} coordinate
standard \citep{astropy_2018}, which places the Sun $8122$ pc from the
galactic center, and assumes the solar velocity with respect to the
local standard of rest from \citet{schonrich_local_2010}.  As input
parameters to HDBScan, we set the minimum $\epsilon$ threshold past
which clusters cannot be fragmented as $25$ parsecs in physical space,
and $c$ \kms\ in velocity.  The minimum cluster size $N$ is set to 10,
as is $k$, the parameter used to define the ``core distance'' density
metric. 

This unsupervised clustering in our case yielded 8 distinct groups.
These groups are then used as the ``seed'' populations for the third
step, which is to search for objects that are spatially and
kinematically consistent with each of the groups, {\bf IMPROVE
CLARITY at least as close to the 10$^{\rm th}$ nearest
HDBSCAN-identified member in space-velocity coordinates as the most
peripheral HDBSCAN-identified member}.  This third step yields stars
that are spatially and kinematically close to the
photometrically-young stars, but which cannot be identified as young
based on their positions in color versus absolute magnitude.

The outcome of the analysis up to the point of the third step is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:XYZvtang}.  To enable a selection cut that
filters out field-star contaminants, we also compute a weight metric,
defined such that the group member with the smallest core distance has
a weight of 1, the group member with the greatest core distance has a
weight of 0, and weights for the other group members are log-normally
distributed between these two extremes.  In Figure~\ref{fig:XYZvtang}, we
show 26{,}960 objects with weight exceeding 0.02 as gray points, and
overplot 7{,}560 objects with weights exceeding 0.10 as black points.
{\bf TODO: FIXME these object numbers impose pretty weak quality cuts and include junk at G>18... 
use get\_clean\_gaia\_photometric\_sources too, since they come in for
the CAMDs}.

The previously known $\delta$~Lyr\ cluster ($l,b=68^\circ,15^\circ$;
$v_{l'}, v_b=-4.5{\rm kms},-4{\rm kms}$) is visible, as is RSG-5
($l,b=83^\circ,6^\circ$, $v_{l'}, v_b=+5.5{\rm kms},-3.5{\rm kms}$).
Most of the other subclusters, including in Cep-Cyg
($l,b=90^\circ,7^\circ$) and Cerberus ($l,b=48^\circ,18^\circ$) are
too small or dispersed to have previously been analyzed in great
detail.

The fourth and final step was cross-matching our candidate Cep-Her
member list against all known Kepler Objects of Interest, including
known false positives \citep{thompson_planetary_2018}.  This yields 32
matches, of which 5 are ``confirmed'' planets according to the NASA
Exoplanet Archive.  A cursory inspection of the Kepler data validation
summaries and Robovetter classifications for these objects quickly
showed whether they were potentially consistent with being {\it i)}
planets, and {\it ii)} $\lesssim 10^8$ years old population, based on
the presence of rotational modulation at the expected period and
amplitude \citep[{\it e.g.},][Figure~9]{rebull_rotation_2020}.  Four
objects remained after this inspection: Kepler-1627, Kepler-1643,
KOI-7368, and KOI-7913.

Figure~\ref{fig:XYZvtang} shows the positions of the KOIs along
various projections.  Kepler-1643 is near the core RSG-5 population
both spatially and kinematically.  KOI-7368 and KOI-7913 are in a more
diffuse region $\approx$40 parsecs above RSG-5 in $Z$ and $\approx$100
parsecs closer to the Sun in $Y$.  In tangential galactic velocity
space, there may be some kinematic overlap between the region the
latter two KOIs are in, and the main RSG-5 group.

We define two sets of stars in the local vicinity of our objects of
interest, in order to verify whether they are indeed the same age.
For candidate RSG-5 members, we require:
\begin{align}
  45<X/{\rm pc}<75 \nonumber \\
  320<Y/{\rm pc}<350 \nonumber \\
  40<Z/{\rm pc}<70 \nonumber \\
  -4<v_b/{\rm km\,s^{-1}}<-3 \nonumber \\
  4<v_{l^*}/{\rm km\,s^{-1}}<6 \nonumber
\end{align}
For the diffuse stars near KOI-7368 and KOI-7913, we require
\begin{align}
	20<X/{\rm pc}<70 \nonumber \\
	230<Y/{\rm pc}<270 \nonumber \\
	75<Z/{\rm pc}<105 \nonumber \\
	-3.5<v_b/{\rm km\,s^{-1}}<-1.5 \nonumber \\
	2<v_{l^*}/{\rm km\,s^{-1}}<6, \nonumber
\end{align}
and we call this latter set of stars ``CH-2''.
% FIXME TODO numbers are from RSG-5_auto_XYZ_vl_vb_cut.csv,
% CH-2_auto_XYZ_vl_vb_cut.csv right now.  Can we do better?
These cuts yield 141 candidate RSG-5 members, and 
37 candidate CH-2 members.
Given the larger volume of the latter group, and the more diffuse base
sample of stars, a major concern is contamination by field stars.
We assess this in the following section.

%Querying the Gaia archive and imposing the cuts suggested by
%\citet[][Appendix B]{GaiaCollaboration2018} on the photometric signal
%to noise ratio, the number of visibility periods used, the
%astrometric $\chi^2$ of the single-source solution, the $G_{\rm
%BP}-G_{\rm RP}$ color excess factor and the parallax precision
%($\varpi/\sigma_\varpi>5$) yields $\approx5.0\times10^6$ sources.
%
%Imposing a thin slice in color-absolute magnitude space around the
%pre-main-sequence of the $\delta$ Lyr cluster's previously
%established $\approx$40 Myr locus, and imposing kinematics cut for
%$-8 < v_b / {\rm km\,s^{-1}} < 0$ and $-15 < v_{l'} / {\rm
%km\,s^{-1}} < 15$, where $l'=l\cos b$, yields $\approx 5.2\times10^3$
%sources.  These objects are all in the range BP-RP 1.5 to 3.2, so
%roughly K5V to M4.5V, or $\approx$0.2 to 0.7 solar masses.  Much more
%manageable, but according to IMF arguments, missing at least a factor
%of two in mass of any clusters.
%
%In XYZ, and in tangential velocity space, these five thousand sources
%are visually clustered in between a few to a dozen groups, depending
%on the characteristic size and velocity scales of interest.

\section{The Stars}
\label{sec:stars}

\input{tab_sysparams.tex}

Many of the relevant stellar parameters can be gleaned by inspecting
Figure~\ref{fig:age}.  The known planet-hosting stars in Cep-Her span
spectral types of G8V (Kepler-1627) to K8V (KOI-7913 A).  The
secondary in the KOI-7913 system is only marginally cooler than the
primary (SpType $\approx$M0V).
The latter system is 3$\farcs$501 
%FIXME FIXME FIXME TODO TODO TODO
A Solar-mass star with solar metallicity arrives at the zero-age main
sequence at $t\approx40$ million years (CITE CHOI MESA), and so these
stars are in the end stages of their pre-main-sequence contraction.
Their Gaia EDR3 parallaxes span X.X to Y.Y, corresponding to distances
between X.X and Y.Y parsecs.

To derive the spectroscopic parameters $(T_{\rm eff}, \log g_\star,
[{\rm Fe/H}])$ and  the equivalent width of the Li\,\textsc{I}
from the 6708\,\AA\ doublet, we acquired spectra.  Specifically, we
acquired iodine-free HIRES spectra for Kepler-1643 (YYYY/MM/DD) and
KOI-7913 (YYYY/MM/DD and YYYY/MM/DD), where for the latter the two
different epochs corresponded to observations of the secondary and
primary respectively.  The acquisition and analysis followed the
standard reduction techniques of the California Planet Survey
\citep{howard_cps_2010}.  For KOI-7368, we acquired TRES spectra on
YYYY/MM/DD and YYYY/MM/DD.  CITE METHOD PAPER.
The results are given in Table~\ref{tab:sysparams}.

Table~\ref{tab:sysparams} summarizes

%
%\citep[{\it e.g.},][]{soderblom_ages_2014}, we acquired an iodine-free
%spectrum from Keck/HIRES on the night of 2021 March 26 using the
%standard setup and reduction techniques of the California Planet
%Survey \citep{howard_cps_2010}.  Following the equivalent width
%measurement procedure described by \citet{bouma_2021_ngc2516}, we find
%${\rm EW}_{\rm Li} = 233^{+5}_{-7}$\,m\AA.   This value does not
%correct for the Fe\,\textsc{I} blend at 6707.44\AA.  Nonetheless,
%given the stellar effective temperature (Table~\ref{tab:starparams}),
%this measurement is in agreement with expectations for a
%$\approx40$\,Myr star ({\it e.g.}, as measured in IC~2602 by
%\citealt{randich_gaiaeso_2018}).  It is also larger than any lithium
%equivalent widths measured by \citet{berger_identifying_2018} in their
%analysis of 1{,}301 Kepler-star spectra.

%Based on the spatial and kinematic association of \sn\ with the \cn,
%and the assumption that the planet formed shortly after the star, it
%seems likely that \sn\ is the same age as the cluster. There are two
%consistency checks on whether this is true: rotation and lithium.
%Based on the Kepler light curve, the rotation period is
%$2.642\pm0.042$\,days, where the quoted uncertainty is based on the
%scatter in rotation periods measured from each individual Kepler
%quarter.  This is consistent with comparable cluster members

    its uncertainty. Kepler-1627 (+), KOI-7368 (down-triangle),
    KOI-7913 (X), Kepler-1643 (diamond).  The large sizes of
		the youngest transiting planets could be explained by their
		primordial atmospheres not yet having evaporated; direct
		measurements of the atmospheric outflows or planetary masses would
		help to confirm this expectation.  Selection effects may also be
		important.  Parameters are from the NASA Exoplanet Archive (2022
