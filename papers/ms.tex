  Stellar positions and velocities from Gaia are yielding a new and
  refined view of how stellar clusters evolve.
  Here we present an analysis of a group of $\approx$40 million
  year old stars spanning Cepheus ($l=100^\circ$) to Hercules
  ($l=40^\circ$), hereafter the Cep-Her complex.  The group contains
  four known Kepler Objects of Interest:
  Kepler-1627 Ab ($R_{\rm p} = 3.85 \pm 0.11\,R_\oplus$, $P = 7.2\ {\rm days}$),
  Kepler-1643 b ($R_{\rm p} = 2.32 \pm 0.14\,R_\oplus$, $P = 5.3\ {\rm days}$),
  KOI-7368 b ($R_{\rm p} = 2.22 \pm 0.12\,R_\oplus$, $P = 6.8\ {\rm days}$), and
  KOI-7913 Ab ($R_{\rm p} = 2.34 \pm 0.18\,R_\oplus$, $P = 24.2\ {\rm days}$).
  Kepler-1627 is a Neptune-sized planet in a sub-component of the
  complex called the $\delta$\ Lyr\ cluster
  \citep{bouma_kep1627_2022}.  Here we focus on the latter three
  systems, which are in other sub-components of the complex (RSG-5 and
  CH-2).  Based on kinematic evidence from Gaia, stellar rotation
  periods from TESS, and spectroscopy, these three systems are also
  $38 \pm 6$ million years old.  Based on the transit shapes and high
  resolution imaging, they are all most
  likely planets (false positive probabilities of $6\times10^{-9}$,
  $5\times10^{-3}$, and $1\times10^{-4}$ for Kepler-1643, KOI-7368,
  and KOI-7913 respectively).  Kepler-1643 and KOI-7913 are therefore
  the first empirical demonstration that mini-Neptunes with sizes of
  $\approx$2 Earth radii exist at ages of roughly 40 million years.

\section{Introduction}

The discovery of young transiting planets is a major frontier in
current exoplanet research.  The reason is that the properties of
these planets can help constrain the timescales for processes
including hot Jupiter migration (CITE), the cooling and contraction of
planets with massive gaseous envelopes (CITE Rizzuto), the early
evolution of close-in multiplanet systems (CITE David), and whether
and how mass-loss explains the radius valley (e.g., CITE, CITE, Lee+21
on theory; CITE CITE CITE on observations).

%FIXME WORDING OF THIS PARAGRAPH NEEDS WORK.  ALSO, WHERE DO YOU PUT
%THE CONTEXT RE CLUSTERS?
Understanding the formation and evolution of stellar clusters is
similarly an emerging frontier in analyses of star formation and
cluster evolution.  In particular, it is understood that most embedded
clusters disperse within a few tens of millions of years after forming
their first stars (CITE).  The discovery of tidal tails (CITE CITE)...
streams (CITE Meingast18, Curtis19), etc...  Connect to moving groups
(CITE Gagne 21).  What are the typical densities for star formation?
How does gas expulsion and the SFE affect cluster morphology?  {\bf
FIXME}

Assuming a constant star formation rate in the Galaxy, $\approx$1\% of
stars are $\lesssim$10$^8$ years old.  While $\approx$5{,}000
transiting exoplanets are known (CITE), 11 currently meet this age
cut.  The discrepancy between the $\approx$50 expected and $\approx$10
known likely has a contribution from selection effects in planetary
detection, which include photometric and spectroscopic starspot
modulation, and the rarity of young stars.

While detecting planets around young and active stars is challenging,
so is measuring stellar ages (see CITE Soderblom for a review).  It
should therefore not be surprising that advances along either
dimension can yield advances in the census of young transiting
planets.

The prime Kepler mission (CITE) found most of the currently known
transiting exoplanets, and it was conducted before the positions,
velocities, and stellar brightnesses measured by Gaia revolutionized
our understanding of stellar clusters (CITE, CITE, CITE).  This
revolution is slated to continue with the upcoming third Gaia data
release (DR3 CITE).  Nonetheless, it seems sensible to revisit the
Kepler field, given our new knowlege of the stellar ages.

In this work, we expand on a previous study of a 38 million year (Myr)
old Neptune-sized planet in the Kepler field (Kepler-1627Ab; CITE).
The age of this planet was derived based on its host star's membership
in the $\delta$\ Lyr\ cluster.  Our analysis of this cluster focused
on the immediate kinematic vicinity of Kepler-1627A in order to
reliably confirm the age of the planet.  However it also became clear
that the $\delta$\ Lyr\ cluster is spatially and kinematically close
to a much larger group of similarly aged stars.  This group, which is
at a distance of roughly 300 parsecs, appears to span Cepheus
($l=100^\circ$) to Hercules ($l=40^\circ$), at galactic latitudes,
$b$, between roughly 0 and 20 degrees.  We therefore refer to it as
the Cep-Her complex.  Viewed top-down in the plane of the Galaxy, the
complex spans roughly 250 parsecs in the direction toward the galactic
center, and 150 parsecs in the perpendicular direction of galactic
rotation.  A detailed kinematic analysis and exploration is currently
being prepared by R.~Kerr and collaborators.

The subject of this study is the intersection of the Cep-Her complex
with the Kepler field, and an analysis of the consequent transiting
planets and planet candidates.  Cross-matching the full set of
candidate Cep-Her members against all known Kepler Objects of Interest
(CITE) yielded XX candidate matches.  Given the purported XX Myr age
of the group, a visual inspection of the light curves quickly enabled
a decision about whether the matches could be valid, based on the
presence or non-presence of stellar rotation signals of the
appropriate periods and amplitudes (CITE REBULL).  Four possible
matches remained from this exercise: Kepler-1627, Kepler-1643,
KOI-7368, and KOI-7913.  Given our previous analysis of Kepler-1627,
we will focus for the most part on the latter three.

\subsection{General Context} % might cut!

Our focus is on a region of the Galaxy roughly 200 to 500 parsecs from
the Sun, above the galactic plane, and spanning galactic longitudes of
roughly $40^\circ$ to $100^\circ$ degrees.  Querying the Gaia archive
and imposing the cuts suggested by \citet[][Appendix
B]{GaiaCollaboration2018} on the photometric signal to noise ratio,
the number of visibility periods used, the astrometric $\chi^2$ of the
single-source solution, the $G_{\rm BP}-G_{\rm RP}$ color excess
factor and the parallax precision ($\varpi/\sigma_\varpi>5$) yields
$\approx5.0\times10^6$ sources.

Imposing a thin slice in color-absolute magnitude space around the
pre-main-sequence of the $\delta$ Lyr cluster's previously established
$\approx$40 Myr locus, and imposing kinematics cut for $-8 < v_b /
{\rm km\,s^{-1}} < 0$ and $-15 < v_{l'} / {\rm km\,s^{-1}} < 15$,
where $l'=l\cos b$, yields $\approx 5.2\times10^3$ sources.  These
objects are all in the range BP-RP 1.5 to 3.2, so roughly K5V to
M4.5V, or $\approx$0.2 to 0.7 solar masses.  Much more manageable, but
according to IMF arguments, missing at least a factor of two in mass
of any clusters.

In XYZ, and in tangential velocity space, these five thousand sources
are visually clustered in between a few to a dozen groups, depending
on the characteristic size and velocity scales of interest.  The first
suggestion that these objects could all be part of a monolithic
structure, to our knowledge, came from the manual grouping that was
performed between them by \citet{KounkelCovey2019} when defining the
structure they dubbed ``Theia~73''.  Different subsets of these stars
have however previously been noticed and studied.  They include the
$\delta$ Lyr cluster, also known as Stephenson-1
\citep{stephenson_possible_1959}, which comprises a major grouping
around $(l,b)=(68^\circ,15^\circ)$, with typical velocities $(v_{l'},
v_b)=(-4.5{\rm kms},-4{\rm kms})$.  Another individual component
that has previously been recognized is RSG-5 \citep{roser_nine_2016}.
This group is at roughly $(l,b)=(83^\circ,6^\circ)$, with velocities
$(v_{l'}, v_b)=(+5.5{\rm kms},-3.5{\rm kms})$.  Most of the other
subclusters, including CH-2, and those in Cep-Cyg and Cerberus are too
small or dispersed to have previously been analyzed in great detail.

\subsection{Actual Membership Selection} % might cut!

% TODO: add words to acknowledge that Cep-Her is not yet demonstrated
% to be a thing

To identify stars in this region of space that could be members of the
Cep-Her complex, we follow the methods of \citet{Kerr2021}.  The
analysis therefore broadly consists of two steps.  The first step is
to select stars that photometrically appear young based on the Gaia
EDR3 magnitudes $\{G, G_{\rm RP}, G_{\rm BP}\}$, in combination with
the parallaxes and reddening estimates.  This method works best for
low-mass stars due to their long pre-main-sequence contraction
timescale, and for massive stars because of their fast evolutionary
timescale.  The second step in the analysis is to use the
photometrically-identified young stars as the ``seed'' for a candidate
population in a spatial and kinematic clustering analysis in $\{ X, Y,
Z, c v_b, c v_{l^*} \} $.  The latter step helps identify F, G, and
K-type stars that cannot be identified as young based solely on their
positions in color versus absolute magnitude.

%FIXME TODO TODO TODO: this analysis!

    The top row shows CAMDs.  Left shows CH-2, right shows RSG-5.  The

    (black points are NGC2547 and IC2602 from Randich+18 and probably
    are not believable at the red end; for Kepler-1643 I'm less
    confident, but it might be tied to the ``slow'' rotation period --
    this is why we need RSG5 rotation periods).  Also, we might want
    an H-alpha plot?).
		\label{fig:age}

The evidence for the RSG-5 and CH-2 sub-groups at least roughly
sharing the age of the $\delta$\ Lyra\ cluster is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:age}.

\section{The Stars}
\label{sec:stars}

\input{tab_sysparams.tex}

Many of the relevant stellar parameters can be gleaned by inspecting
Figure~\ref{fig:age}.  The known planet-hosting stars in Cep-Her span
spectral types of G8V (Kepler-1627) to K8V (KOI-7913 A).  The
secondary in the KOI-7913 system is only marginally cooler than the
primary (SpType $\approx$M0V).
The latter system is 3$\farcs$501 
%FIXME FIXME FIXME TODO TODO TODO
A Solar-mass star with solar metallicity arrives at the zero-age main
sequence at $t\approx40$ million years (CITE CHOI MESA), and so these
stars are in the end stages of their pre-main-sequence contraction.
Their Gaia EDR3 parallaxes span X.X to Y.Y, corresponding to distances
between X.X and Y.Y parsecs.

To derive the spectroscopic parameters $(T_{\rm eff}, \log g_\star,
[{\rm Fe/H}])$ and  the equivalent width of the Li\,\textsc{I}
from the 6708\,\AA\ doublet, we acquired spectra.  Specifically, we
acquired iodine-free HIRES spectra for Kepler-1643 (YYYY/MM/DD) and
KOI-7913 (YYYY/MM/DD and YYYY/MM/DD), where for the latter the two
different epochs corresponded to observations of the secondary and
primary respectively.  The acquisition and analysis followed the
standard reduction techniques of the California Planet Survey
\citep{howard_cps_2010}.  For KOI-7368, we acquired TRES spectra on
YYYY/MM/DD and YYYY/MM/DD.  CITE METHOD PAPER.
The results are given in Table~\ref{tab:sysparams}.

Table~\ref{tab:sysparams} summarizes
%
%from the 
%
%
%\citep[{\it e.g.},][]{soderblom_ages_2014}, we acquired an iodine-free
%spectrum from Keck/HIRES on the night of 2021 March 26 using the
%standard setup and reduction techniques of the California Planet
%Survey \citep{howard_cps_2010}.  Following the equivalent width
%measurement procedure described by \citet{bouma_2021_ngc2516}, we find
%${\rm EW}_{\rm Li} = 233^{+5}_{-7}$\,m\AA.   This value does not
%correct for the Fe\,\textsc{I} blend at 6707.44\AA.  Nonetheless,
%given the stellar effective temperature (Table~\ref{tab:starparams}),
%this measurement is in agreement with expectations for a
%$\approx40$\,Myr star ({\it e.g.}, as measured in IC~2602 by
%\citealt{randich_gaiaeso_2018}).  It is also larger than any lithium
%equivalent widths measured by \citet{berger_identifying_2018} in their
%analysis of 1{,}301 Kepler-star spectra.
%
%
%% rotation period from plot_rotation_period_windowslider.py
%Based on the spatial and kinematic association of \sn\ with the \cn,
%and the assumption that the planet formed shortly after the star, it
%seems likely that \sn\ is the same age as the cluster. There are two
%consistency checks on whether this is true: rotation and lithium.
%Based on the Kepler light curve, the rotation period is
%$2.642\pm0.042$\,days, where the quoted uncertainty is based on the
%scatter in rotation periods measured from each individual Kepler
%quarter.  This is consistent with comparable cluster members
%(Figure~\ref{fig:age}).
