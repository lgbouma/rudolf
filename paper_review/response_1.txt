Line 93: Clarify origin of name delta Lyr, given there are two
pre-existing names, and how they overlap. It might also be worth
mentioning Kerr's Cep-Her association as in prep just to save future
readers the headache of cross-identifying them, either here or in Sec
2.1

REVIEWER COMMENT

Fig 3: It may be helpful to include one of the even younger clusters
on the CMD (i.e. to bracket delta Lyra), though perhaps it makes the
plot too busy.

RESPONSE
----------

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Page 3: Consider re-organizing. Based on the 1st paragraph, I thought
the quantitative analysis would only deal with Pleiades and IC 2602
and one might infer reddening was only calculated for these clusters
(whereas I assume the latter are also corrected for reddening prior
to the analysis described). My suggestion would be to introduce all
the clusters first. It would also be helpful to list the age of IC
2602 at some point in the text.

RESPONSE
----------
> Thank you for this suggestion.  The first paragraph of Section

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 202 (binaries): Add RUWE citation(s). Nice approach to remove
radial_velocity_error based on each cluster's distribution. It should
be noted somewhere in this discussion that the target itself does
*not* meet the RUWE limit and so wouldn't appear on the plot by
default.

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 209: I don't follow starting "assembled a piecewise grid of
hybrid isochrones..." What does "hybrid" mean here? Once the splines
for each cluster are defined, how does one interpolate between them?
Are the ages then determined for each star and combined?

RESPONSE
----------

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 230 (age): Consider adopting a systematic error (perhaps
corresponding to the range noted for the extremes of the ages) in
addition to the random (assumed to be the quoted +6/-5 error).
Relatedly, how are the quoted errors derived?

RESPONSE
----------

REVIEWER COMMENT

Line 235: May be worth mentioning the restriction to the 391 stars in
the beginning of sec 2.2.2.

REVIEWER COMMENT

Line 278: "Indistinguishable" -- from each other or from the Pleiades?

RESPONSE
----------
> From each other (and the manuscript has been updated; thank you!).

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 286: I thought I remember Curtis or Douglas citing binarity as a
possibility for stars above to slow sequence as well, but I don't
have a reference on-hand.

RESPONSE
----------

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Section 3.2: The text mentions statistical and systematic
uncertainties but I only see one set of errors listed in Table 1.
Were these uncertainties combined or was only one adopted in the end?

RESPONSE
----------
> They were combined in quadrature (see Line 331 of the original
> manuscript, "Reported uncertainties are a quadrature sum of the

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 391: It would be helpful to state the star's RUWE in the text here.
Additionally, I believe RUWE acornym was already defined previously.

REVIEWER COMMENT

One note about the transit analysis: The MuSCAT3 data was introduced
as supporting evidence but the conclusion (that the transits appear
achromatic) was never explicitly stated.

Abstract
line 24: Kepl-1627Ab cannot be a "mini-Neptune" if it is same size of
Neptune.  Replace with "Neptune-size" Yes, it falls within a
distribution of objects in a period-radius diagram with an average
that is smaller than Neptune, but claiming affiliation with smaller
objects implies more than we know about this planet, e.g. its mass.

RESPONSE
----------
> Point well-taken.  R_p = 3.82 +/- 0.16 R_earth, so yes, Kepler-1627
> Ab is the same size as Neptune within 1-sigma.  All instances in
> the text that referred to Kepler-1627 Ab as a mini-Neptune have
> been modified to call it a "Neptune-sized planet", including the
> manuscript's title.

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
line 25: Kepler target stars were chosen for their suitability for
transiting detection of planets in general, and for planets that are
Earth-analogs in paraticular. That involves radius, brightess.
Distance and spectral types were not direct selection criteria; this
was before Gaia.

RESPONSE
----------
> Indeed.  Batalha+2010 (ApJL) discuss the selection function, which
> favored stars that were both small and bright since these stars
> enable the detection of Earth-size planets.  M dwarfs thus were
> generally excluded unless they happened to be very close.  F, G,
> and K stars were favored, particularly when they were nearby.  The
> sentence in L25 currently states that "The star was observed by the
> Kepler space telescope because it is nearby (d=329pc) and it
> resembles the Sun".  More directly, yes, the star was chosen
> because it was thought that it might enable the detection of small
> planets in the habitable zone.  However the underlying reason for
> why the star enables such detections is based on the star's
> brightness and assumed radius, which both factor into the transit
> SNR.  Our claim therefore holds, albeit indirectly.  It also serves

REVIEWER COMMENT

Intro

Line 47: (First paragraph on p 2) the time-scale of 1e8 is associated
with one particular set of photoevaporation models; core-powered mass
loss proposes timescales of Gyr(s) (see the Ginzburg paper that was
cited). More recent photoevaporation models also propose 1 Gyr
timescales. It would be good to revise/update this paragraph.

RESPONSE
----------
> The sentence corresponds to a claim that mini-Neptunes are

> 10^8 years".   The Owen 2020 models are then cited because this is

Section 2

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Lines 142-144: perhaps rephrasing this would clarify that the authors
did not use Kepler-1627 as a fiducial star about which to select
cluster members, and that they restricted the analysis to one of
several sub-clusters or clumps which contained Kepler-1627.

RESPONSE
----------

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Figure 1: the first three panels would be more effective if they were
plotted at the same scale and with appropriately aligned axes. As
such the upper right panels are too small to be useful. Consider
leaving out the Sun (which is irrelevant) so as to have a more
appropriate choice of scale to how the details of the cluster. The
purpose of the fourth panel (tangential velocities) and the second
line in the caption are unclear to me. Aren't the tangential
velocities known from Gaia proper motions and parallaxes? Why
calculate them with the assumption of common space motion? If that is
done, what does it show, anyway?

p 5 lines 258-261: rather than simply throw the TESS values out in

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 604-608: The statement that the density from the transit
duration is inconsistent with that expected for the M dwarf "B" cites
Table 2 and Choi+2016, but that Table does not appear to provide any
information on "B", and the Choi+2016 reference is just for the Mesa
models. A density of 2 g/cm3 (or lower) is possible for an M dwarf on
the pre-main sequence, depending on the mass, age and model used.

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Lines 613-614: it would be good to quantify this, i.e. how faint an
unresolved companion or background star must be based on the star's
position in the CMD.

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Lines 635-638: Here, new observations appear for the first time but
are not described. While the details are given in the appendix, and
the outcome of the observations doesn't define this work, the authors
need to give some basic description of the observations, e.g.
passbands, SNR, resolution, observation times, etc. The authors
should not assume the reader actually know what HIRES and MuSCAT are!

RESPONSE
----------

> spectroscopically with HIRES at the Keck-I telescope and
> photometrically in $griz$ bands with MuSCAT3 at Haleakal\=a
> Observatory.  Details of the observation sequence are discussed in

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Section 5

line 670: assuming that SNR is not to blame, the problem is not
precision, the problem is either measuremnt systematics or
astrophysical noise.

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
line 678-683: The Ca II HK activity indicator "S" as well as the
H-alpha equivalent width could be obtained from the HIRES spectrum.
Have the authors checked fora X-ray or UV (Galex) detection of this
star? The star is likely not detected but its worth a look. In the
same vein, the authors may wish to comment on whether the star's
infrared emission indicates or rule out a substantial debris disk --
the star is detected in WISE (and perhaps Spitzer?)

REVIEWER COMMENT

lines 699-701 It could be mentioned here that the planet orbital
period and stellar rotational period are not a rational combination.
