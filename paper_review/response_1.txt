Line 93: Clarify origin of name delta Lyr, given there are two pre-existing
names, and how they overlap. It might also be worth mentioning Kerr's Cep-Her
association as in prep just to save future readers the headache of
cross-identifying them, either here or in Sec 2.1

Line 165: Consider mentioning the axes on which data was cleaned (e.g. color
precision)

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 179 (reddening): What does "reasonably well" mean? Something like 1-2
sigma?

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Fig 3: It may be helpful to include one of the even younger clusters on the CMD
(i.e. to bracket delta Lyra), though perhaps it makes the plot too busy.

RESPONSE
----------
> Please see camd_with_UCL.png and camd_with_UCL_no_redcorr.png

> our opinion.


REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Page 3: Consider re-organizing. Based on the 1st paragraph, I thought the
quantitative analysis would only deal with Pleiades and IC 2602 and one might
infer reddening was only calculated for these clusters (whereas I assume the
latter are also corrected for reddening prior to the analysis described). My
suggestion would be to introduce all the clusters first. It would also be
helpful to list the age of IC 2602 at some point in the text.

RESPONSE
----------
> Regarding the main re-organization point, FIXME TODO REORGANIZE?

> Regarding the last point, the final paragraph of Section 2.2.1

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 202 (binaries): Add RUWE citation(s). Nice approach to remove
radial_velocity_error based on each cluster's distribution. It should be noted
somewhere in this discussion that the target itself does *not* meet the RUWE
limit and so wouldn't appear on the plot by default.

RESPONSE
----------

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 209: I don't follow starting "assembled a piecewise grid of hybrid
isochrones..." What does "hybrid" mean here? Once the splines for each cluster
are defined, how does one interpolate between them? Are the ages then
determined for each star and combined?

RESPONSE
----------

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 230 (age): Consider adopting a systematic error (perhaps corresponding to
the range noted for the extremes of the ages) in addition to the random
(assumed to be the quoted +6/-5 error). Relatedly, how are the quoted errors
derived?

RESPONSE
----------

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 235: May be worth mentioning the restriction to the 391 stars in the
beginning of sec 2.2.2.

RESPONSE
----------
> Done, thank you.

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 278: "Indistinguishable" -- from each other or from the Pleiades?

RESPONSE
----------
> From each other (and the manuscript has been updated; thank you!).

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 286: I thought I remember Curtis or Douglas citing binarity as a
possibility for stars above to slow sequence as well, but I don't have a
reference on-hand.

RESPONSE
----------
> Thanks for this point -- we've updated the text with a reference to
> Stauffer+16.  In their Section 5.1, they discuss the case of some
> unresolved F+K binaries in the Pleiades which show anomalously long
> K2 rotation periods.


REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Section 3.2: The text mentions statistical and systematic uncertainties but I
only see one set of errors listed in Table 1. Were these uncertainties combined
or was only one adopted in the end?

RESPONSE
----------
> They were combined in quadrature (see Line 331 of the original
> manuscript, "Reported uncertainties are a quadrature sum of the
> statistical and systematic components."

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 391: It would be helpful to state the star's RUWE in the text here.
Additionally, I believe RUWE acornym was already defined previously.

RESPONSE
----------
> Done, thank you.

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Section 3.2: Comment on whether the binary companion should effect the rotation
measurement of the host star (either here, or in the rotation section).

RESPONSE
----------

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
One note about the transit analysis: The MuSCAT3 data was introduced as
supporting evidence but the conclusion (that the transits appear achromatic)
was never explicitly stated.

RESPONSE
----------
> Line 642 of the original manuscript notes "Although we did not
> detect the RM anomaly, the multi-band MuSCAT3 light curves show that
> the transit is achromatic (Figure 7)."

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 725: The fast rotation period and flares could plausibly effect the
completeness.

RESPONSE
----------
> These completeness statistics were computed using KeplerPORTS (the

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 729: Considering Owen 2020, contraction could also contribute to some
extent to the larger radii of small planets; might this be significant?

RESPONSE
----------
> TODO WHAT?

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Appendix A paragraph beginning at line 1158: May be worth mentioning that delta
Lyr may also be part of one of these heirarchical associations.

RESPONSE
----------
> Done, thank you.

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Figure 13 caption: Specify planetary orbital period since technically there is
also a stellar orbital period involved.

Abstract
line 24: Kepl-1627Ab cannot be a "mini-Neptune" if it is same size of Neptune.
Replace with "Neptune-size" Yes, it falls within a distribution of objects in a
period-radius diagram with an average that is smaller than Neptune, but
claiming affiliation with smaller objects implies more than we know about this
planet, e.g. its mass.

RESPONSE
----------
> Point well-taken. 
> R_p = 3.79 +/- 0.16 R_earth, so yes, this is the same size as
> Neptune within 1-sigma.

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
line 25: Kepler target stars were chosen for their suitability for transiting
detection of planets in general, and for planets that are Earth-analogs in
paraticular. That involves radius, brightess. Distance and spectral types were
not direct selection criteria; this was before Gaia.

Intro

Line 47: (First paragraph on p 2) the time-scale of 1e8 is associated with one
particular set of photoevaporation models; core-powered mass loss proposes
timescales of Gyr(s) (see the Ginzburg paper that was cited). More recent
photoevaporation models also propose 1 Gyr timescales. It would be good to
revise/update this paragraph.

Section 2

Line 65: it is convention to italicize names of space missions like TESS and K2

RESPONSE
----------
>

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Lines 142-144: perhaps rephrasing this would clarify that the authors did not
use Kepler-1627 as a fiducial star about which to select cluster members, and
that they restricted the analysis to one of several sub-clusters or clumps
which contained Kepler-1627.

RESPONSE
----------

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Figure 1: the first three panels would be more effective if they were plotted
at the same scale and with appropriately aligned axes. As such the upper right
panels are too small to be useful. Consider leaving out the Sun (which is
irrelevant) so as to have a more appropriate choice of scale to how the details
of the cluster. The purpose of the fourth panel (tangential velocities) and the
second line in the caption are unclear to me. Aren't the tangential velocities
known from Gaia proper motions and parallaxes? Why calculate them with the
assumption of common space motion? If that is done, what does it show, anyway?

REVIEWER COMMENT

Figure 3 bottom: Can the IC 2602 and 2391 rotation periods be added to this
plot? Lines 276-278 mention that these and cite Douglas et al. 2021 (although
the reference does not seem to be complete). Isn't it interesting that the
interlopers all fall on the Praesepe rotation sequence?

RESPONSE
----------

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
p 5 lines 258-261: rather than simply throw the TESS values out in favor of the
Kepler ones, the authors should compare them to evaluate the accuracy and
reliability of the TESS values.

Section 4.1.3 and Figure 6

The significance of this slope is unclear and a sigma is not a good way to
evaluate it. Perform a ratio of chi-squared or F-test to evaluate it vs. a flat
line.

RESPONSE
----------

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Lines 530-542: does option (ii) include a transit fit as well? I assume it does
but it would be good to clarify. And is option (i) the 2nd and 4th order
polynomial? Perhaps just state this?

Section 4.2

Analysis of the motion of the photocentroid has been widely used to help
validate Kepler planets. Can this be used here to distinguish between the
possible A and B host stars?

RESPONSE
----------

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 604-608: The statement that the density from the transit duration is
inconsistent with that expected for the M dwarf "B" cites Table 2 and
Choi+2016, but that Table does not appear to provide any information on "B",
and the Choi+2016 reference is just for the Mesa models. A density of 2 g/cm3
(or lower) is possible for an M dwarf on the pre-main sequence, depending on
the mass, age and model used.

RESPONSE

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Lines 613-614: it would be good to quantify this, i.e. how faint an unresolved
companion or background star must be based on the star's position in the CMD.

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Lines 635-638: Here, new observations appear for the first time but are not
described. While the details are given in the appendix, and the outcome of the
observations doesn't define this work, the authors need to give some basic
description of the observations, e.g. passbands, SNR, resolution, observation
times, etc. The authors should not assume the reader actually know what HIRES
and MuSCAT are!

Section 5

line 678-683: The Ca II HK activity indicator "S" as well as the H-alpha
equivalent width could be obtained from the HIRES spectrum. Have the authors
checked fora X-ray or UV (Galex) detection of this star? The star is likely not
detected but its worth a look. In the same vein, the authors may wish to
comment on whether the star's infrared emission indicates or rule out a
substantial debris disk -- the star is detected in WISE (and perhaps Spitzer?)
