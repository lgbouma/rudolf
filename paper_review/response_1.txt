Line 93: Clarify origin of name delta Lyr, given there are two pre-existing
names, and how they overlap. It might also be worth mentioning Kerr's Cep-Her
association as in prep just to save future readers the headache of
cross-identifying them, either here or in Sec 2.1

REVIEWER COMMENT

Line 179 (reddening): What does "reasonably well" mean? Something like 1-2
sigma?

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Fig 3: It may be helpful to include one of the even younger clusters on the CMD
(i.e. to bracket delta Lyra), though perhaps it makes the plot too busy.

RESPONSE
----------

> our opinion.


REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Page 3: Consider re-organizing. Based on the 1st paragraph, I thought the
quantitative analysis would only deal with Pleiades and IC 2602 and one might
infer reddening was only calculated for these clusters (whereas I assume the
latter are also corrected for reddening prior to the analysis described). My
suggestion would be to introduce all the clusters first. It would also be
helpful to list the age of IC 2602 at some point in the text.

RESPONSE
----------
> Regarding the main re-organization point, FIXME TODO REORGANIZE?

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 202 (binaries): Add RUWE citation(s). Nice approach to remove
radial_velocity_error based on each cluster's distribution. It should be noted
somewhere in this discussion that the target itself does *not* meet the RUWE
limit and so wouldn't appear on the plot by default.

RESPONSE
----------

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 209: I don't follow starting "assembled a piecewise grid of hybrid
isochrones..." What does "hybrid" mean here? Once the splines for each cluster
are defined, how does one interpolate between them? Are the ages then
determined for each star and combined?

RESPONSE
----------

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 230 (age): Consider adopting a systematic error (perhaps corresponding to
the range noted for the extremes of the ages) in addition to the random
(assumed to be the quoted +6/-5 error). Relatedly, how are the quoted errors
derived?

RESPONSE
----------

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 235: May be worth mentioning the restriction to the 391 stars in the
beginning of sec 2.2.2.

RESPONSE
----------
> Done, thank you.

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 278: "Indistinguishable" -- from each other or from the Pleiades?

RESPONSE
----------
> From each other (and the manuscript has been updated; thank you!).

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 286: I thought I remember Curtis or Douglas citing binarity as a
possibility for stars above to slow sequence as well, but I don't have a
reference on-hand.

RESPONSE
----------
> Thanks for this point -- we've updated the text with a reference to
> Stauffer+16.  In their Section 5.1, they discuss the case of some

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Section 3.2: The text mentions statistical and systematic uncertainties but I
only see one set of errors listed in Table 1. Were these uncertainties combined
or was only one adopted in the end?

RESPONSE
----------
> They were combined in quadrature (see Line 331 of the original
> manuscript, "Reported uncertainties are a quadrature sum of the
> statistical and systematic components."

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 391: It would be helpful to state the star's RUWE in the text here.
Additionally, I believe RUWE acornym was already defined previously.

RESPONSE
----------
> Done, thank you.

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Section 3.2: Comment on whether the binary companion should effect the rotation
measurement of the host star (either here, or in the rotation section).

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
One note about the transit analysis: The MuSCAT3 data was introduced as
supporting evidence but the conclusion (that the transits appear achromatic)
was never explicitly stated.

RESPONSE
----------

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 725: The fast rotation period and flares could plausibly effect the
completeness.

RESPONSE
----------

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 729: Considering Owen 2020, contraction could also contribute to some
extent to the larger radii of small planets; might this be significant?

RESPONSE
----------
> TODO WHAT?

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Appendix A paragraph beginning at line 1158: May be worth mentioning that delta
Lyr may also be part of one of these heirarchical associations.

Abstract
line 24: Kepl-1627Ab cannot be a "mini-Neptune" if it is same size of Neptune.
Replace with "Neptune-size" Yes, it falls within a distribution of objects in a
period-radius diagram with an average that is smaller than Neptune, but
claiming affiliation with smaller objects implies more than we know about this
planet, e.g. its mass.

RESPONSE
----------
> Point well-taken.  R_p = 3.82 +/- 0.16 R_earth, so yes, Kepler-1627 Ab is the
> same size as Neptune within 1-sigma.  All instances in the text that referred
> to Kepler-1627 Ab as a mini-Neptune have been modified to call it a
> "Neptune-sized planet" (including the manuscript's title).

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
line 25: Kepler target stars were chosen for their suitability for transiting
detection of planets in general, and for planets that are Earth-analogs in
paraticular. That involves radius, brightess. Distance and spectral types were
not direct selection criteria; this was before Gaia.

RESPONSE
----------
> Indeed.  Batalha+2010 (ApJL) discuss the selection function, which favored
> stars that were both small and bright since these stars enable the detection
> of Earth-size planets.  M dwarfs thus were generally excluded unless they
> happened to be very close.  F, G, and K stars were favored, particularly when
> they were nearby.  The sentence in L25 currently states that "The star was
> observed by the Kepler space telescope because it is nearby (d=329pc) and it
> resembles the Sun".  More directly, yes, the star was chosen because it was
> thought that it might enable the detection of small planets in the habitable

> scales is that the star was relatively bright, and it also fell within a
> particular color range.  That color range (given the Batalha+2010 logg cuts)
> corresponds to Sun-like stars.  And the brightness range for Sun-like stars
> corresponds to stars within a particular distance limit.  Our claim therefore

Intro

Line 47: (First paragraph on p 2) the time-scale of 1e8 is associated with one
particular set of photoevaporation models; core-powered mass loss proposes
timescales of Gyr(s) (see the Ginzburg paper that was cited). More recent
photoevaporation models also propose 1 Gyr timescales. It would be good to

Section 2

Line 65: it is convention to italicize names of space missions like TESS and K2

RESPONSE
----------

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Lines 142-144: perhaps rephrasing this would clarify that the authors did not
use Kepler-1627 as a fiducial star about which to select cluster members, and
that they restricted the analysis to one of several sub-clusters or clumps
which contained Kepler-1627.

RESPONSE
----------

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Figure 1: the first three panels would be more effective if they were plotted
at the same scale and with appropriately aligned axes. As such the upper right
panels are too small to be useful. Consider leaving out the Sun (which is
irrelevant) so as to have a more appropriate choice of scale to how the details
of the cluster. The purpose of the fourth panel (tangential velocities) and the
second line in the caption are unclear to me. Aren't the tangential velocities
known from Gaia proper motions and parallaxes? Why calculate them with the
assumption of common space motion? If that is done, what does it show, anyway?

RESPONSE
----------

Figure 3 bottom: Can the IC 2602 and 2391 rotation periods be added to this
plot? Lines 276-278 mention that these and cite Douglas et al. 2021 (although
the reference does not seem to be complete). Isn't it interesting that the
interlopers all fall on the Praesepe rotation sequence?

REVIEWER COMMENT
----------
Line 604-608: The statement that the density from the transit duration is
inconsistent with that expected for the M dwarf "B" cites Table 2 and
Choi+2016, but that Table does not appear to provide any information on "B",
and the Choi+2016 reference is just for the Mesa models. A density of 2 g/cm3

the mass, age and model used.
