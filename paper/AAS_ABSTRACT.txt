Kepler 1627A is a G8V star previously known to host a 3.8 $R_\oplus$ mini-Neptune on a 7.2 day orbit.  The star was observed by the Kepler space telescope because it is nearby ($d=329$ pc) and it resembles the Sun.  Here we show using Gaia kinematics, TESS stellar rotation periods, and spectroscopic lithium abundances that Kepler 1627 is a member of the $38^{+6}_{-5}$ Myr old $\delta$ Lyr cluster.  To our knowledge, this makes Kepler 1627Ab the youngest planet with a precise age yet found by the main Kepler mission.  The Kepler photometry shows two peculiarities: the average transit profile is asymmetric, and the individual transit times might be correlated with the local light curve slope.  We discuss possible explanations for each anomaly.  More importantly, the $\delta$ Lyr cluster is one of $\sim$10$^3$ coeval groups whose properties have been clarified by Gaia.  Many other exoplanet hosts are candidate members of these clusters; these memberships can be verified with the trifecta of Gaia, TESS, and ground-based spectroscopy.
