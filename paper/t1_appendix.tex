Table~\ref{tab:v05} is
published in its entirety in a machine-readable format.   This table is a
concatenation of the studies listed in Table~\ref{tab:metadata}.
One entry is
shown for guidance regarding form and content. 
In this particular example, the star has a
cold Jupiter on a 16 year orbit, HD 150706b \citep{2012AA...545A..55B}.
An infrared excess has been reported \citep{CottenSong2016}, and the star was identified by \citet{Ujjwal2020} as a candidate UMa moving group
member ($\approx 400\,{\rm Myr}$; \citealt{mann_tess_2020}).
The star's RV activity and TESS rotation period corroborate its youth.
