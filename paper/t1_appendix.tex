Table~\ref{tab:v06} is published in its entirety in a machine-readable
format.   This table is a concatenation of the studies listed in
Table~\ref{tab:metadata}.  One entry is shown for guidance regarding
form and content.  In this particular example, the star has a cold
Jupiter on a 16 year orbit, HD 150706b \citep{2012AA...545A..55B}.  An
infrared excess has been reported \citep{CottenSong2016}, and the star
was identified by \citet{Ujjwal2020} as a candidate UMa moving group
member ($\approx 400\,{\rm Myr}$; \citealt{mann_tess_2020}).  The
star's RV activity and TESS rotation period corroborate its youth.
