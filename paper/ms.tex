\begin{abstract}
  Kepler\,1627A is a G8V star previously known to host a
  $3.5\,R_\oplus$ mini-Neptune on a 7.2\,day orbit.  The star was
  observed by the Kepler satellite because it is nearby
  ($d=329\pm3\,{\rm pc}$) and it resembles the Sun.  Combining
  kinematic information from Gaia, stellar rotation periods from TESS,
  and Li abundances from ground-based spectra, we show that
  Kepler\,1627 is a member of the $35^{+6}_{-5}$\,Myr old $\delta$~Lyr
  cluster.  To our knowledge, Kepler\,1627Ab is the youngest planet
  with a precise age yet found by the main Kepler mission.  From both
  unresolved starspot-crossing events in the Kepler photometry and
  from a Keck/HIRES transit we find that the planet is
  likely on an orbit nearly aligned with the stellar spin axis.  We
  also find from the short-cadence Kepler photometry that although the
  flare arrival time distribution is probably Poissonian, there may be
  an excess of flares separated by the orbital and synodic periods,
  and linear combinations thereof.  The $\delta$~Lyr cluster is one of
  many stellar groups whose properties have been clarified using the
  Gaia data; many of the other new clusters also overlap with
  confirmed and candidate exoplanets.  Further studies that combine
  Gaia kinematics and TESS rotation periods are poised to expand the
  census of age-dated planets, and our understanding of planetary
  evolution.

\section{Introduction}

While thousands of exoplanets have been discovered orbiting nearby
stars, the vast majority of them are several billion years old.  This
makes it difficult to test origin theories for the different families
of planets, since many evolutionary processes are expected to operate
on timescales of less than 100 million years.

%TODO: might want to revise this text to better frame the boil-off phase...
%TODO: better citations on radius evolution?
For instance, the ``mini-Neptunes'', thought to be made of molten
rocky cores \citep{kite_atmosphere_2020} and extended atmospheric
envelopes of hydrogen and helium, are expected to shrink in size by
factors of several over their first $10^8$ years
\citep{owen_atmospheres_2016,owen_constraining_2020}.  Specifically,
they start with sizes of 4--12\,$R_\oplus$ shortly after the time of disk
dispersal ($\lesssim$$10^7$\,years), and shrink to sizes of
2--4\,$R_\oplus$ by 10$^8$ years.  While the majority of this change
is expected to occur within the first few million years of the disk's pressure
support being removed \citep{owen_atmospheres_2016}, the combination of stellar
irradiation and internal heat may also power a more
gradual outflow which can eventually deplete or entirely strip the
envelope from the rocky core
\citep{Owen_Wu_2013,ginzburg_corepowered_2018}.  Discovering young
planets, measuring their masses, and detecting their atmospheric
outflows are key steps toward testing this paradigm, which is often
invoked to explain the observed radius distribution of mature
exoplanets \citep{Fulton_et_al_2017}.

The K2 and TESS missions have now enabled the detection of about ten
close-in planets younger than 100 million years, all smaller than
Jupiter
\citep{Mann_K2_33b_2016,David_et_al_2017,david_four_2019,newton_tess_2019,bouma_cluster_2020,plavchan_planet_2020,rizzuto_tess_2020}.
The Kepler mission however has not yielded any planets with precise
ages below one gigayear \citep{Meibom_et_al_2013}.  The reason is that
at the time of the main Kepler mission (2009--2013), only four open
clusters were known in the Kepler field: NGC\,6866, NGC\,6811,
NGC\,6819, and NGC\,6791, with ages spanning 0.7\,Gyr to 9\,Gyr
\citep{meibom_kepler_2011}.  Since that time, analyses of the
kinematic, photometric, and astrometric Gaia data have expanded our
knowledge of open cluster and moving group memberships \citep[{\it
e.g.},][]{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018,zari_3d_2018,kounkel_untangling_2019,Meingast2021,kerr_stars_2021}.
As part of our Cluster Difference Imaging Photometric Survey (CDIPS,
\citealt{bouma_cdipsI_2019}), we concatenated the available analyses
from the literature, which yielded a list of candidate young and
age-dated stars (see Appendix~\ref{app:targetlist}).

Comparing our young star list against the Kepler field yielded two
discoveries.  The first, to be discussed in an upcoming analysis by
J.~Curtis et al{.}, is that Kepler observed the $\approx$350\,Myr open
cluster Theia\,520 (UBC\,1).  At least six Kepler planets are known in
the cluster from the Kepler-52 and Kepler-968 systems
\citep{rowe_validation_2014,jontof-hutter_following_2021}.  The second
discovery, and the focus of this work, is that Kepler observed a
portion of the $\delta$\,Lyr cluster (Stephenson-1; Theia~73;
\citealt{stephenson_possible_1959}).  Figure~\ref{fig:skychart} shows
the overlap between the Kepler field and the cluster.

A previous clustering analysis of the Gaia data reported that
Kepler\,1627 (KIC 6184894; KOI 5245; TIC 120105470) is a member of the
\cn\ \citep{kounkel_untangling_2019}.  Given the previous statistical
validation the close-in mini-Neptune Kepler 1627b
\citep{2012ApJS..199...24T,morton_false_2016,thompson_planetary_2018},
we examined the age of the star and its putative host cluster more
closely (Section~\ref{sec:cluster}).  We find that the $\delta$ Lyr
cluster is $35^{+6}_{-5}$\,Myr old, and that \sn\ is indeed a member
of the cluster.  Focusing on the planet itself,
we confirm that despite the presence of a previously unreported binary companion,
the planet orbits the G-dwarf primary star on an orbit that appears aligned
with the stellar rotation axis
(Section~\ref{sec:planet}).  We conclude by
highlighting broader implications for our ability to age-date a
statistical sample of planets (Section~\ref{sec:conc}).

   \label{fig:age}
	}
\end{figure*}

To assess the age of the cluster and our star of interest, we used a
combination of isochronal, gyrochronal, and lithium-based
age-dating.

\subsection{Color-Magnitude Diagram}
\label{sec:cmd}

We meaured the isochrone age using an empirical approach.  The left
panel of Figure~\ref{fig:age} shows the color-magnitude diagram (CMD)
of stars in the \cn, IC\,2602, the Pleiades, and the field.  The stars
shown in the \cn\ are selected based on their positions and
kinematics, as discussed in Appendix~\ref{app:kinematicselection}.
Those from the Pleiades and IC\,2602 are adopted from
\citet{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018}, and the field stars are from the Gaia
EDR3 Catalog of Nearby Stars \citep{gaia_gcns_2021}.  We cleaned these
following identical data filtering criteria discussed in Appendix~B of
\citet{GaiaCollaboration2018}, except that we weakened the parallax
precision requirement to $\varpi/\sigma_\varpi>5$.  These filters were
designed to include genuine binaries while omitting instrumental
artifacts.  We then corrected for extinction by querying the
3-dimensional maps of \citet{capitanio_threedimensional_2017} and
\citet{lallement_threedimensional_2018}\footnote{\url{https://stilism.obspm.fr/}},
and by then applying the extinction coefficients $k_X\equiv A_X/A_0$
computed by \citet{GaiaCollaboration2018} while assuming that $A_0 =
3.1 E(B-V)$.  For IC\,2602, the Pleiades, and the \cn, this procedure
yielded a respective mean and standard deviation for the reddening of
$E(B-V)=\{0.020\pm0.003, 0.045\pm0.008, 0.032\pm0.006\}$.  These
values agree reasonably well with previously reported values from the
literature \citep[{\it
e.g.},][]{GaiaCollaboration2018,kounkel_untangling_2019,bossini_age_2019}.

% Gaia+2018 E(B-V):
% Pleiades 0.045, IC2602 0.031
%
% Randich+2018 E(B-V):
% Pleiades ??, IC2602 0.032 - 0.092
%
% KC2019: AV->E(B-V)
% Pleiades 0.220 AV -> 0.071
% IC2602 0.243297 -> 0.078
% Stephenson1 0.184 -> 0.059
%

% PleiadesMelotte22 0.140 -> 0.045
% IC2602 0.096 -> 0.031
% Steph1: 0.157 -> 0.051

Figure~\ref{fig:age} shows that the \cn\ and IC\,2602 overlap, and are
therefore approximately the same age.  In our exploration, we also
compared against $\mu$-Tau ($62\pm7$\,Myr; \citealt{gagne_mutau_2020})
and the Upper-Centaurus-Lupus (UCL) component of the Sco OB2
association ($\approx$$16$\,Myr; \citealt{pecaut_star_2016}).  The
pre-main-sequence M dwarfs of the \cn\ were intermediate between these
latter two groups.  To turn this heuristic interpolation into an
age measurement, we used the empirical procedure
developed by \citet{gagne_mutau_2020}.  In brief, we fitted the
pre-main-sequence loci of a set of reference clusters, and the locus
of the target \cn\ was then modeled as a piecewise linear combination
of these reference clusters.  For our reference clusters, we adopted
members of UCL, IC\,2602, and the Pleiades from
\citet{damiani_stellar_2019} and \cite{CantatGaudin2018a}
respectively.  We removed binaries by requiring $\texttt{RUWE}<1.3$,
$\texttt{radial\_velocity\_error}$ below the 80$^{\rm th}$ percentile
of each cluster's distribution, and by manually excluding stars that
were obvious photometric binaries in the CMD.  We then passed a moving
box average and standard deviation across the CMD in 0.10\,mag bins,
fitted a univariate spline to the binned values, and assembled a
piecewise grid of hybrid isochrones spanning the ages between UCL to
the Pleiades following Equations~6 and~7 from
\citet{gagne_mutau_2020}.  

The ages returned by this procedure depend on the ages assumed for
each reference cluster.  We adopted a 115\,Myr age for the Pleiades,
and a 16\,Myr age for UCL \citep{dahm_2015,pecaut_star_2016}.
The age of IC\,2602 however is the most important
ingredient, since it receives the most weight in the interpolation.
Plausible ages for IC\,2602
span 30\,Myr to 46\,Myr, with slightly older ages being preferred by
the lithium-depletion-boundary (LDB) measurements and younger ages by
the main-sequence turn-off
\citep{stauffer_rotational_1997,dobbie_ic_2010,david_ages_2015,randich_gaiaeso_2018,bossini_age_2019,bouma_cluster_2020}.
If we were to adopt the 30\,Myr age for IC\,2602, then the \cn\ would
be $31^{+5}_{-4}$\,Myr old.  For the converse case of 46\,Myr, the
\cn\ would be $44^{+8}_{-7}$\,Myr old.  We adopt an intermediate
35\,Myr age as our reference, yielding an age for the \cn\ of
$35^{+6}_{-5}$\, Myr, though it should be understood based on the
systematic uncertainties that an age of up to $\approx50$\,Myr remains
plausible.  Detailed analyses of the LDB or main-sequence turn-off in
the \cn\ could help resolve the issue, but both are beyond our scope.



\subsection{Stellar Rotation Periods}

Of the \noriginal\ candidate \cn\ members reported by
\citet{kounkel_untangling_2019}, TESS data were available for
\nwithtess\ stars.\footnote{Kepler rotation periods were derived by
\citet{mcquillan_rotation_2014} for 56 stars; in these cases, we
adopted the Kepler rotation period.  } We extracted light curves from
the TESS images using the nearest pixel to each star, and regressed
them against systematics with the causal pixel model implemented in
the \texttt{unpopular} package \citep{hattorio_2021_cpm}.  We then
measured candidate rotation periods using a Lomb-Scargle periodogram
\citep{lomb_1976,scargle_studies_1982,astropy_2018}.  To enable cuts
on crowding, we queried the Gaia source catalog for stars within a
$21\farcs0$ radius of the target star (1 TESS pixel).  We recorded the
number of stars within the aperture with greater brightness than the
target star, and with brightness within 1.25 and 2.5 TESS magnitudes
of the target star.  

We cleaned the candidate TESS rotation period measurements through a
combination of automated and manual steps.  As a matter of scope, we
restricted our attention to the \nkinwithtess\ stars in the spatial
and kinematic proximity of Kepler\,1627, as discussed in
Appendix~\ref{app:kinematicselection}.  We also only focused on stars
for which no companions were known with a brightness exceeding
one-tenth of the target star within a $21\farcs0$ radius: there were
\nkinwithtessandcrowding\ stars that met these requirements, and that
had TESS data available.  For plotting purposes we then imposed a
selection based on the strength of the rotation period signal itself:
we required the Lomb Scargle power to exceed 0.2, and the period to be
below 15\,days.

The lower panel of Figure~\ref{fig:age} shows the resulting
\nkindefaultcleaning\ stars.  The majority of these stars fall below
the ``slow sequence'' of the Pleiades, consistent with a
gyrochronological age for the \cn\ below 100\,Myr.  Approximately 10
stars appear as outliers above the ``slow sequence''.  Assuming that
they are all false positives ({\it i.e.}, field interlopers), the
rotation period detection fraction would be
$\nrotgood/\nkinwithtessandcrowding \approx \nfracprot\%$.

Binarity is known to be an important factor in the density of stars
falling underneath the slow sequence
\citep{meibom_effect_2007,gillen_ngts_2020,bouma_2021_ngc2516}.
Appendix~\ref{app:rotationbinarity} discusses this topic, and finds
evidence for similar effects to those that have been previously
discussed in the literature.

\subsection{Age of Kepler\,1627}

In brief, the age of the \cn\ cluster based on the empirical
fitting procedure described in Section~\ref{sec:cmd} is
$35^{+6}_{-5}$\,Myr.  This procedure hinges on the age adopted for
IC\,2602, since it is the closest reference cluster in the
color-magnitude diagram.  Gyrochronologically, while most of the G and
K dwarfs in the \cn\ have not yet converged to a slow sequence, their
rotation distribution and that of the F dwarfs is consistent with the
same age.  The rotation periods of other 30\,Myr to 50\,Myr clusters
({\it e.g.}, IC\,2602 and IC\,2391) are indistinguishable
\citep{douglas_stephanie_t_2021_5131306}.  The most precise age for \sn\ and its
planet are therefore also $35^{+6}_{-5}$\, Myr, based on the star's
spatial, kinematic, and rotational connection to this larger ensemble,
and the assumption that the planet formed very quickly after the star.

Beyond the kinematic and rotational lines of evidence for the youth of
\sn, there is a final consistency check: the abundance of
Li\,\textsc{I} as inferred from the 6708\,\AA\ doublet.  The utility
of this element for age dating young stars has been reviewed by
\citet{soderblom_ages_2014}.  We acquired an iodine-free spectrum from
Keck/HIRES on the night of 26 March 2021 using the standard setup and
reduction techniques of the California Planet Survey
\citep{howard_cps_2010}.  Following the equivalent width measurement
procedure described by \citet{bouma_2021_ngc2516}, we measure ${\rm
EW}_{\rm Li} = 233^{+5}_{-7}\,$m\AA.   Note that this value does not
correct for the Fe\,\textsc{I} blend at 6707.44\AA.  Given the stellar
parameters of \sn\ (Table~\ref{tab:starparams}), most notably its
effective temperature, this measurement is also in agreement with an
age for the star between 30\,Myr and 50\,Myr (see {\it e.g.}, Figure~9
of \citealt{bouma_2021_ngc2516}, or the data from
\citealt{randich_gaiaeso_2018}).

%TODO: fix sizes and numbers
If the \pn\ transit signal is created by a bonafide planet,  then to
our knowledge its age would make it the youngest planet yet found by
the main Kepler mission.\footnote{The re-purposed K2 mission found two
slightly younger systems: K2-33b
\citep{David_et_al_2017,Mann_K2_33b_2016} and V1298 Tau
\citep{david_four_2019}}  A portion of the light curve is shown with
the phase-folded transit in Figure~\ref{fig:lc}.  The dominant signal
in the \texttt{PDCSAP} photometry is a quasi-periodic starspot signal
with a peak-to-peak amplitude that varies between roughly 2\% and 8\%,
depending on the degree of asymmetry in spot coverage between the
stellar hemispheres.  The starspot signal repeats every
$2.642\pm0.042$\,days, where we have adopted an uncertainty based on
the scatter observed between different portions (quarters) of the
time-series data.  The details of how we model this starspot signal to
derive the parameters of the planet are discussed in
Appendix~\ref{app:gptransit}.  The results, given in
Table~\ref{tab:posterior}, are consistent with a mini-Neptune sized
planet ($3.56\pm 0.04\,R_\oplus$) on a circular 7.2\,day orbit
($e<0.XX$), around a G8V star ($0.91 \pm 0.05 R_\odot$).  {\bf TODO
quote the eccentricity limit}

Could the transit signal be produced by anything other than a planet
orbiting this near-solar analog?  \citet{morton_false_2016} considered
the false positive scenarios of a foreground eclipsing binary, a
hierarchical triple-star binary system, and a background eclipsing
binary.  Based on the transit shape, \citet{morton_false_2016} found
the latter scenario to be the only possible case, with a
(model-dependent) probability of $\approx10^{-5}$. Most
reported failures of the statistical validation approach have arisen when attempting
to separate the smallest stars from identically-sized gas giant
planets \citep[{\it e.g.},][]{shporer_three_2017}.  With a size of
$\approx 3.5\,R_\oplus$, Kepler\,1627b does not meet this concern.
The fact that we detect a low-mass stellar companion in archival
Keck-NIRC2 Kp-band (2.12\,$\mu $m) imaging does not change the
conclusion: the companion star contributes 1\% of the flux observed by
Kepler.  Combined with the observed transit depth and shape
(Appendix~\ref{app:companionstar}), a planet transiting the primary
star is the only plausible interpretation of the data.

{\bf todo: LGB to check numbers on full-dataset transit ecc and b} 
Three additional new lines of evidence confirm the planetary
interpretation.  First, the $\approx$100 days of 1-minute
cadenced Kepler observations reduce the cadence-induced smearing,
enabling a more precise measurement of the transit impact parameter
\citep{kipping_binning_2010}.  The planet transits with $b<0.YY$
(3-$\sigma$) from the 1-minute cadenced data, compared to $<0.XX$
(3-$\sigma$) from the 30-minute data.
This implies an even stronger constraint on the transit shape in an
analysis of the false positive probability.

The second line of evidence comes from our transit timing analysis. We
isolated each of the 144 observed transits to within $\pm4.5$\,hr of
each transit, and fitted each window with both {\it i)} a local
second-order polynomial and transit, and {\it ii)} a local linear
trend.  We let the mid-time of each transit float, and then calculated
the residual between the measured mid-time and that of a perfectly
periodic orbit.  This residual, the ``transit timing variation''
(TTV), is plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:obliquity} against the local
linear slope.  A significant negative slope of $-0.0564 \pm 0.0098\
{\rm ppt\,day}^{-1}$ is observed.  Only a handful of Kepler Objects of
Interest have shown this correlation \citep{holczer_time_2015}, which
is most readily interpreted as a TTV induced by unresolved starspot
crossings \citep{mazeh_time_2015}.  This is only possible if the
planet transits the primary star, which excludes the aforementioned
false positive scenarios.  It also implies that the planet's orbit is
prograde.  The latter interpretation assumes that the dominant
photometric variability is induced by dark spots, rather than bright
faculae.  Given the observed transition of Sun-like stellar
variability from spot to faculae-dominated regimes, we expect this
inference to be reasonably secure
\citep{shapiro_are_2016,montet_long-term_2017,reinhold_stellar_2020}.

The final line of evidence confirming \pn\ comes from a spectroscopic
transit we measured from Keck/HIRES during the night of 7 Aug 2021
(UT), using the iodine cell for the wavelength calibration.  We
scheduled the transit using the ephemeris of
\citet{holczer_transit_2016}, which we verified using the available
TESS data.  We also acquired simultaneous multi-band photometry using
MUSCAT3, to help interpret the radial velocities \citep{Narita_2020}.
The lower panels in Figure~\ref{fig:obliquity} show the results.  The
photometry shows the expected starspot trend, along with the transit
and a likely starspot crossing event at ${\rm JD} - 2459433 = 0.955$.
The radial velocities show significant scatter, though a significant
increase in RV is seen shortly after the expected ingress.  The
internal uncertainties on the RVs ($\approx 15\,{\rm m\,s}^{-1}$) is
dominated by the $v\sin i$ broadening.

We fitted the RVs using the \citet{hirano_analytic_2010,hirano_2011}
models for the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, which we parametrized
with three parameters: the sky-projected obliquity, the stellar
equatorial velocity, and the gaussian dispersion of spectral lines.
We then allowed for a linear and optionally quadratic trend, along
with a white-noise jitter term.  The quadratic model with the RM
effect is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:obliquity}.  We found $\chi^2_{\rm
red} = 5.4$ for the best-fitting linear case, and $\chi^2_{\rm red} =
4.4$ for the best-fitting quadratic, with a $\Delta {\rm BIC} = {\rm
BIC}_{\rm lin} - {\rm BIC}_{\rm quad} = 19.6$ and $\Delta {\rm AIC} =
{\rm AIC}_{\rm lin} - {\rm AIC}_{\rm quad} = 20.6$.  While this
provides strong statistical evidence to prefer the quadratic model
over the linear one, the $\chi^2_{\rm red}$ indicate that neither fit
is particularly good.  Considering a quadratic trend alone without any
RM effect yields $\chi^2_{\rm red} = 4.3$, and $\Delta {\rm BIC} =
{\rm BIC}_{\rm trend} - {\rm BIC}_{\rm quad} = 1.9$ (similarly $\Delta
{\rm AIC}=5.2$); from a model-comparison standpoint, there is only
weak statistical evidence to prefer the best-fitting ``RM and
quadratic trend'' model over the best-fitting ``quadratic trend only''
model.  Given the expected semi-amplitude of the velocity anomaly
($\Delta v_{\rm RM}\approx 20\,{\rm m\,s}^{-1}$) and the actual achieved
precision, the claim of having ``detected the Doppler
transit'' is therefore marginal.  Observationally however, we
know from the MUSCAT3 data that the transit was observed, and the
increase in radial velocity observed shortly after ingress is more
consistent with a prograde or polar orbit than a retrograde one.
Fixing the orbit to be either exactly prograde or exactly retrograde
and allowing for a quadratic trend, we find $\Delta {\rm BIC} = {\rm
BIC}_{\rm retrograde} - {\rm BIC}_{\rm prograde} = 20.4$; the
retrograde case is ruled out on this basis.  More precise data will
however still be useful to make a more precise obliquity measurement.

Kepler\,1627Ab therefore provides a new extremum in the ages of the
Kepler planets, and opens multiple avenues for study from the ground.
Observations of its Doppler transit are expected to induce a
Rossiter-McLaughlin anomaly with an amplitude of $\approx 20$\ms, and
could yield a quantification of the stellar obliquity, and a means for
verifying our transit-timing based suggestion of a prograde orbit.
Similar transit spectroscopy aimed at detecting either hydrogen or
helium absorption could yield insight into the planet's atmosphere,
which is expected to be outflowing at a rate of {\bf
X.X}\,$M_\oplus\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ (CITE).  A more challenging
measurement would be a measurement of the planet's mass, through
either detailed timing analyses of the Kepler data, or through a
high-cadence multi-color radial velocity campaign.  The mass could
yield constraints on both the planet's composition as well as its
initial entropy \citep{owen_constraining_2020}.

The precision of the Kepler data itself may enable more detailed
analyses without needing to acquire more data.  While our transit
timing study did not yield the detection of any clearly significant
planet-planet induced TTVs, the star's flaring may be suggestive of
star-planet interactions.  Appendix~\ref{app:flare} highlights an odd
flare timing coincidence that may be worthy of further examination.

In the context of the known transiting planets, \pn\ is among the
youngest known (Figure~\ref{fig:rp_period_age}).  Comparable systems
with precisely measured ages spanning 10 to 100\,Myr include K2-33b,
DS~Tuc~Ab, HIP~67522b, TOI~837b, AU~Mic~b, and the four-planet
V1298~Tau system
\citep{Mann_K2_33b_2016,David_et_al_2017,newton_tess_2019,david_four_2019,bouma_cluster_2020,plavchan_planet_2020}.
Of these systems, \pn\ inhabits a similar range of planetary size and
orbital period.  It is the smallest though ($3.6\,R_\oplus$), which
may hint at selection effects in the sample of young planets
\citep{zhou_2021_tois}.  Assuming that these planets have masses
between $\approx$10 and 20$\,M_\oplus$, their large sizes and presumed
low densities are in accord with the expectation that mini-Neptunes
start their lives with large primordial atmopsheres that are are lost
over the first gigayear
\citep{Owen_Wu_2013,Fulton_et_al_2017,ginzburg_corepowered_2018}.
The observation from starspot-induced TTVs that the planetary orbit
could be aligned with the stellar spin differs from a number of other
close-in
mini-Neptunes~\citep{sanchis-ojeda_starspots_2011,albrecht_obliquities_2012,dalal_2019_hd3167,rubenzahl_tess-keck_2021}.
Overall however, it is consistent with a quiescent disk-driven
migration history for the planet, while the in-situ formation scenario
is disfavored because the necessary disk mass would always drive
planets to migrate
\citep{inamdar_formation_2015,ogihara_reassessment_2015}.


% TODO: decide whether a paragraph about young planet obliquities is
% needed.

% The orbits of the planets can also change early on, and can become
% significantly misaligned from the equators of their host stars.
% Measurements of the sky-projected angle between the planet orbit and
% the stellar spin (the stellar obliquity) have shown that high
% obliquities characterize hot field stars hosting both hot Jupiters and
% smaller planets \citep{winn10,louden21}.  Conversely, the obliquities
% of planets around cool stars tend to be low, but this could be due to
% tidal realignment \citep[{\it e.g.},][]{anderson21}.  Obliquity
% measurements for young planets are therefore important, because they
% provide an unobstructed view of the primordial obliquity distribution. 



Ultimately, our age measurement for \pn\ was enabled by identifying
its connection to the \cn\ using the Gaia data.  The Supplementary
Table~\ref{tab:v05} enables similar crossmatches to already known
planets, as well as forthcoming planets from the TESS mission
\citep{ricker_transiting_2015,guerrero_tess_2021}.  An alternative
approach would be to identify kinematic associations around exoplanet
host stars using tangential velocities from Gaia, and to then verify these associations
with ancilliary rotation periods and spectroscopy
\citep{tofflemire_tess_2021}.

\section{Young, Age-Dated, and Age-Dateable Star Compilation}
\label{app:targetlist}

\input{t1_appendix.tex}
\input{t2_appendix.tex}

The \texttt{v0.5} CDIPS target catalog (Table~\ref{tab:v05}) includes
some important updates from previous versions.  As in
\citet{bouma_cdipsI_2019}, we collected membership information for
young, age-dated, or age-dateable stars from across the literature.
Table~\ref{tab:metadata} gives a list of the sources included, and
some brief summary statistics.

The first major important change is that the extent of analyses
performed on the Gaia data at the time of our compilation was wide and
deep enough that we opted to neglect pre-Gaia analyses, except in
cases for which spectroscopically confirmed samples of stars had been
collected.  The membership lists for instance of
\citet{Kharchenko_et_al_2013} and \citet{dias_proper_2014} (MWSC and
DAML) were no longer required, especially given their relatively high
field-star contamination rates compared to Gaia-derived membership
catalogs.

For any of the catalogs for which Gaia DR2 identifiers were not
immediately available, we either followed the spatial (plus
proper-motion) crossmatching procedures described in
\citet{bouma_cdipsI_2019}, or else we pulled the Gaia DR2 source
identifiers associated with the catalog from SIMBAD.  We consequently
opted to drop the $\texttt{ext\_catalog\_name}$ and $\texttt{dist}$
columns maintained in \citet{bouma_cdipsI_2019}, as these were only
populated for a small number of stars.

The most crucial parameters of a given star for our purposes are the
Gaia DR2 source identifier ($\texttt{source\_id}$), the cluster name
($\texttt{cluster}$), and the ($\texttt{age}$).  Given the
hierarchical nature of many stellar associations, we do not attempt to
resolve the cluster names to a single unique string.  The Orion
complex for instance, can be divided into almost one hundred kinematic
subgroups \citep{kounkel_apogee2_2018}.  Similar complexity applies to
the problem of determining homogeneous ages, which we do not attempt
to resolve.  Instead, we simply merged the cluster names and ages
reported by various authors together.

This means that our ``age'' column can be null, for cases in which the
original authors did not report an age, and a reference literature age
was not readily available.  Nonetheless, since we do generally prefer
stars with known ages, we made a few additional efforts to populate
this column.  When available, the age provenance is from the original
analysis of the cluster.  However, in a few cases we adopted other
ages when the string-based crossmatches on the ``cluster'' name was
straightforward.  In particular, we used the ages determined by
\citet{CantatGaudin2020b} to assign ages to the catalogs from
\citet{GaiaCollaboration2018}, \citet{CantatGaudin2018a},
\citet{CastroGinard2020}, and \citet{CantatGaudin2020a}.

The catalogs we included for which ages were not immediately available
were those of \citet{CottenSong2016}, \citet{Oh2017},
\citet{Zari2018}, \citet{Gagne2018a},
\citet{Gagne2018b},\citet{Gagne2018c}, and \citet{Ujjwal2020}.  While
in principle the moving group members discussed by
\citet{Gagne2018a,Gagne2018b,Gagne2018c} and \citet{Ujjwal2020} have
easily associated ages, our SIMBAD cross-matching lost the moving
group association from those studies, which should therefore be
recovered tools such as BANYAN
$\Sigma$.\footnote{\url{http://www.exoplanetes.umontreal.ca/banyan/banyansigma.php}}.
We also included the SIMBAD object identifiers $\texttt{TT*}$,
$\texttt{Y*O}, $\texttt{Y*?}, $\texttt{TT?}$, and $\texttt{pMS*}$.
Finally, we also included every star in the NASA Exoplanet Archive
$\texttt{ps}$ table that had a Gaia identifier available
\citep{NASAExoArchive_ps_20210506}.  If the age had finite
uncertainties, we also included it, since stellar ages determined
through the combination of isochrone-fitting and transit-derived
stellar densities typically have higher precision than from isochrones
alone.

The technical manipulations for the merging, cleaning, and joining
were performed using $\texttt{pandas}$
\citep{mckinney-proc-scipy-2010}.  The eventual crossmatch (using the
Gaia DR2 $\texttt{source\_id}$) against the Gaia DR2 archive was performed
asychronously on the Gaia archive
website\footnote{\url{https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/}}.


\section{Kinematic Selection of $\delta$\,Lyr Cluster Members}
\label{app:kinematicselection}

\begin{figure*}[t]

	\vspace{-0.7cm}
	\caption{
    {\bf Galactic position and tangential velocities of the

    Points are candidate cluster members with $\varpi/\sigma_\varpi >
    20$, reported to be in the group by
    \citet{kounkel_untangling_2019}.  We focus on stars in a small
    region (black points) in the kinematic vicinity of Kepler\,1627
    (yellow star).  The other candidate cluster members (gray points)
    may or may not share the ages of the selected kinematic group.
    The location of the Sun is ($\odot$) is shown.
		\label{fig:XYZvtang}
	}
\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{fig:XYZvtang} shows stars reported by
\citet{kounkel_untangling_2019} to be in the group ``Theia 73'', which
was cross-matched by Kounkel \& Covey as being ``Stephenson 1''.
\citet{kounkel_untangling_2019} reported \noriginal\ stars to be
present in this cluster.  For our Figure, galactic positions were
calculated and plotted only for stars with parallax signal-to-noise
exceeding 20.  The location of the Sun is shown on the plots.  The
smattering of reported cluster members (gray and black points) has a
significantly different structure that the cluster initially
identified by \citet{stephenson_possible_1959} and corroborated by
\citet{eggen_photometric_1968}.  While the non-uniform ``clumps''
might be part of a real structure, they could also be an artifact of
the data processing steps performed by
\citet{kounkel_untangling_2019}.  We therefore opted to only consider
stars in the immediate kinematic and spatial vicinity of \sn.  The
tangential velocities relative to \sn\ are shown in the bottom right
panel.  These are computed by assuming that every star has the same
three-dimensional spatial velocity as \sn, where we assume a systemic
radial velocity of $-16.7 \pm 0.2$\,\kms\ based on the reconnaissance
spectra obtained by A.~Howard on HIRES and D.~Latham on TRES.  The
relevant projection effects are then taken into account, as discussed
by {\it e.g.}, \citet{Meingast2021} and \citet{bouma_2021_ngc2516}.
We performed the actual selection by then manually drawing lassos with
the interactive \texttt{glue} visualization tool
\citep{beaumont_2014_13866} in the four projections shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:XYZvtang}.  While bonafide members likely exist
outside of our selection region (and our selection also includes some
field star interlopers), our aim is to verify the existence of the
cluster in the vicinity of Kepler\,1627, and to measure its age.  The
procedure we have adopted enables both tasks.

  \caption{ {\bf Binarity indicators for rotators in \cn.} 
    Data are as in the lower panel of
    Figure~\ref{fig:age}.  Astrometric binaries ($\mathrm{RUWE}>1.2$)
    appear in red; photometric binaries ($>$0.3\,mag above an
    empirical isochrone; 20\% of stars) are orange.  
    Over $0.6<\bpmrpo<1.5$, the detected rotation periods in binaries tend to 
    fall below the slow sequence.
    %FIXME!
		% Over $0.5<\bpmrpo<1.3$, Set $\mathcal{B}$ has \replaced{281}{523} stars.

		% \replaced{56\% (40/71)}{51\% (68/134)}, respectively.
		\label{fig:binarity}
	}
\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{fig:binarity} shows the rotation-color diagram for \cn\
members, with the points colored according to indicators of binarity.
The binaries tend to be redder and have shorter rotation periods.  We
know of two possible explanations based on selection effects, and two
based on physics.

Possible selection effects include {\it i)} binaries have a component
that contributes additional red light to the system, which could skew
the color measurement of the primary; and {\it ii)} the unresolved
binary companions could contaminate the rotation period measurement
\citep[{\it e.g.},][Section~5.1]{stauffer_rotation_2016}.

The two possible physical effects that could be relevant are tidal
locking and pre-main-sequence disk locking.  Tidal locking has been
argued to be an unlikely explanation for the frequency of rapid
rotators due to the population statistics; a more likely scenario
would be that the presence of the binary leads to faster disk
dispersal, enabling the primary to contract to more rapid rotation
periods than possible for single stars
\citep{meibom_effect_2007,bouma_cluster_2020}.

We assumed a quadratic limb-darkening law, with the uninformative prior
advocated by CITET Kipping2013.

% In the first approach, we adopted uniform priors centered on the
% interpolated CITET Claret+2011 coefficients in the Kepler-band, with
% with $\pm 0.2$ in either parameter.  The fit was not as good.

Our default stellar variability model (RotGPtransit) allows for a
\texttt{RotTerm} GP kernel, with a logjitter term to inflate the
uncertainties to account for excess white noise.  (This results in an
inflation of the uncertainties by a factor of about three).

We considered including an additive \texttt{SHOTerm} kernel to account
for stochastic noise (RotStochGPtransit).  This didn't seem to affect
the results much, so we opted for the simpler model.

Figure~\ref{fig:phasefold} shows X, Y, Z.  The residuals during the
transit may hint at some small degree of unfitted signal -- in the
sense that the observations are systematically high in the first half
of transit, and low in the second half.  This is the phase of maximal
scatter during each orbital period (TODO: in vs out of transit
scatter).  The amplitude of the anomaly is $\approx$30\,ppm.

To explore the origin of the anomaly, we binned the Kepler data over
quarters (Figure~\ref{fig:phasequarter}) and years
(Figure~\ref{fig:phaseyear}).  In Figure~\ref{fig:phasequarter}
Quarter 6 shows the strongest asymmetry out of any of the quarters: a
deviation of about 3\,ppt from expectation.  Quarter 7 shows an
anomaly at roughly the same transit phase.  Year 2 correspondingly
shows the strongest anomaly out of any year in
Figure~\ref{fig:phaseyear}.

We considered three possible explanations for the anomaly: gravity
darkening, transit timing variations, and spot-crossing events.

Gravity darkening (e.g., CITE Masuda 2015) is based on the premise
that the rapidly rotating star becomes oblate, and brighter near the
poles than the equator.  The fractional shape change due to gravity
darkening is on the order of $(P_{\rm break}/P_{\rm rot})^2$, for
$P_{\rm break}$ the break-up rotation period, and $P_{\rm rot}$ the
rotation period.  Using the parameters from Table~\ref{tab:posterior},
this yields an expected 1.6\% distortion of the $\approx$1.8\,ppt
transit depth: {\it i.e.}, an absolute deviation of $\approx$3\,ppm.
This is smaller than the observed anomaly by an order of magnitude,
and therefore seems unlikely.

The scenario of transit timing variations (TTVs) producing the
asymmetry seems unlikely, since the analysis by
\citet{holczer_transit_2016} implies that any such variations in \sn\
need to be less than of order minutes.  Figures~\ref{fig:phasequarter}
and~\ref{fig:phaseyear} also provide little evidence in support of
this possibility.

The final possibility is that of starspot crossings.  Given the high
expected spot-covering fractions for young stars ({\it e.g.},
\citealt{morris_relationship_2020}, \citealt{plavchan_planet_2020}),
\pn\ may cross spot groups on the stellar surface in projection.
Spot-crossing anomalies often reach amplitudes exceeding 100\,ppm
({\it e.g.}, CITE Dai 2018, maybe Southworth's recent stuff).  For our
system,  $P_{\rm orb}/P_{\rm rot} \approx 2.76$.  This means that
every 4 transits (and 11 stellar rotations), the planet crosses over
roughly the same stellar longitude.  Over a given quarter, this could
occur at most three times, assuming the spot groups are persistent.  

This could provide a plausible path to creating the distorted transit
signal, based on the amplitudes involved.  However, the typical S/N
per Kepler transit is $\approx8$, making individual spot-crossing
unresolved, and this scenario challenging to test.  {\it A priori},
one would also expect the spot-crossing events to not have a preferred
orbital phase, so that they would average out over the $\approx200$
Kepler transits.  Nonetheless, given the available data, it is our
best explanation for what we believe is real additional photometric
scatter observed during the transits.

    flares does not reach the $5$-$\sigma$ threshold.

	}
\end{figure*}

The short cadence (1-minute) Kepler observations span 97.7 days.
The light curve shows a significant number of flares
(Figure~\ref{fig:flarezoom}).
To quantify clean the light curve and identify the flares, we
performed the following procedure.
For cleaning, we performed the following iterative detrending procedure.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Step 1: Build a two-term mixed SHOTerm GP model with
    quasi-periodic kernels at Prot and 0.5$\times$Prot. Fit the model
    to the time, flux, and flux uncertainty.
  \item Step 2: Select points more than twice the median absolute
    deviation from the residual, and exclude them from the light
    curve.  Repeat Step 1.
  \item Step 3: On the residual from Step 2, identify all flares,
    requiring them to be at least 20 cadences apart, at least 7 median
    absolute deviations above the median baseline, and lasting at least
    2 cadences in duration.  Build the mask spanning these times, from
    5 minutes before each flare begins to 2.5 minutes after the final
    flare cadence.  Repeat Step 1 a final time.
\end{itemize}
The flares were then identified and fitted using ALTAIPONY (CITE CITE).
The fitted model is that of CITE XXX, which parametrizes the flare
with a start time, a lag time, and an amplitude (CHECK).
Figure~\ref{fig:flarephase} shows the resulting flares, amplitudes,
and phases.

There were $N_{\rm f}=24$ flares exceeding $0.5\%$ in relative flux during the
short-cadence observations.  These 24 flares spanned a total of 6.5
hours ($\sim$15 minutes per flare).  For better or worse, we noticed a
coincidence in the flare arrival times.  The coincidence is that
despite the low flare duty cycle, one orbital period after the
brightest flare, a second flare followed.  This and a similar event
are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:flarezoom}.  The timing error is good to
a $\approx0.2\%$ difference from the orbital period, which seems {\it
a priori} unlikely.  If we consider flares falling within 2\% of the
planet's orbital period after a previous flare, then 4 of the 24 flare
events have candidate ``successors''.

As with any coincidence, when one does not have a firm prediction, it
is difficult to assess the statistical significance of a surprise.
Since our surprise was specifically at the inter-arrival time of
certain flares coinciding with special time intervals, we performed
the following analysis.  First, we considered all unordered pairs of
flares.  For $N$ flares there are ${n \choose 2}$ such pairs (for our
case, 276 pairs).  We then compared the distribution of the pair
separations against that from a Poisson distribution.  Specifically,
we drew $N_{\rm f}=24$ samples from a Poisson distribution with
$\lambda = \Delta t / N_{\rm f}$, for $\Delta t=97.7\,{\rm days}$ the
duration of the observations, and repeated the draw $10^3$ times with
unique random seeds.

Figure~\ref{fig:flarestats} shows the results.  The vertical lines in
the figure show the planetary orbital period, the synodic period
$P_{\rm syn} = (P_{\rm rot}^{-1} - P_{\rm orb}^{-1})^{-1}$, and linear
combinations thereof.  Note that the tidal period (half the synodic
period) is not shown.  The bins are logarithmically spaced to give 100
bins between the minimum and maximum ordinate values.  The gray bands
express the range of values observed from the Poissonian draws.  While
it does seem like a rather odd coincidence for peaks in the observed
flare arrival time distribution to coincide with the locations of
these ``special intervals'', the statistical evidence for a
non-Poissonian process driving the flares does not seem particularly
strong.  More quantitatively, the peaks observed at the orbital and
synodic periods are within the $\pm 2$-$\sigma$ range of a
Poissonian process, and those at $P_{\rm orb}+P_{\rm syn}$ and $P_{\rm
orb}+2P_{\rm syn}$ are only slightly above this range. 
With that said,
future analyses of these data by investigators more versed in the
topic than ourselves could very well yield new insights.



\section{Companion Star and False Positive Assessment}
\label{app:companionstar}

    a binary.

    \label{fig:ao}
	}
\end{figure*}

Our analysis of archival Keck-NIRC2 Kp-band (2.12\,$\mu $m) imaging
revealed the existence of a previously unreported stellar neighbor,
unresolved in the Gaia source catalog {\bf FIXME: uncertainties}.  The
NIRC2 images yield a projected separation $\rho=0\farcs17$, with
$\Delta {\rm Kp} = 2.5$.  Using the measured Gaia EDR3 parallax for
the system, this implies a projected separation of 54\,AU.  The
presence of this star is consistent with the excess noise in the Gaia
astrometric time-series (see Section~\ref{app:companionstar}).  Given
the low chance of a star imaged within {\bf X.X arcseconds} to be a
chance companion along the line of sight, we proceed under the
assumption that it is bound, and that the Kepler\,1627 system is
binary.

Unforuntately, we do not have any reliable color information about
Kepler\,1627B.  Based on the
tabulation\footnote{\url{http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/EEM_dwarf_UBVIJHK_colors_Teff.txt},
version \texttt{2021/03/02}.} by \citet{pecaut_mamajek_2013}, the
measured NIR-contrast for a main sequence G8V star corresponds to a
spectral type for the companion of $\approx$M2V ($M_\star \approx
0.44\,M_\odot$).  However, the companion should have a longer
pre-main-sequence contraction phase than the primary, which would
imply that this mass is overestimated by $\sim10$ to $20\%$.

Could the companion be creating a false positive signal?  The
companion star contributes $\approx$1\% of the total flux observed in
the Kepler aperture (0.7-2.0\% V-band to G-band dmag difference from
EEM table; todo is fix using model spectra).  The observed transit has
a depth of 0.18\%.  An 18\% deep eclipse of the secondary star would
therefore be needed to produce a deep enough signal.  The shape of the
observed signal requires allowed impact parameters to span 0.02 to
0.73 (Table~\ref{tab:posterior}); the body transiting the secondary
would therefore need to be non-grazing with $R_3/R_2 \approx 0.42$.
Assuming a $\approx 0.42R_\odot$ radius of the imaged secondary, this
would imply a tertiary stellar radius of $\approx 0.2R_\odot$.  This
scenario ultimately yields a contradiction, because it would require
an ingress and egress phase that each span $\approx$40\% of the
transit duration ($\approx 65\,{\rm minutes}$).  The actual measured
ingress and egress duration is $\approx 15\,{\rm minutes}$),
4.4$\times$ shorter.

\paragraph{Stellar density implied by transit duration}
The duration of the transit ($2.823 \pm 0.057 hr$) and the implied
stellar density ($2.31 \pm 0.52\,{\rm g\,cm}^{-3}$) could in theory
help rule between whether the transiting body orbits the primary or
secondary star.  Ultimately, our stellar density measurement is not
precise enough to render the blend scenario implausible.  At 30 Myr, a
0.40\,$M_\odot$ solar-metallicity dwarf is $\approx 26\%$ larger than
when it is fully contracted on the main sequence (0.40\,$R_\odot$
vs{.} 0.50\,$R_\odot$; CITEALT: Choi et al, MIST grids).  The
theoretically implied companion density of $3.2\,{\rm g\,cm}^{-3}$ is
indeed larger than the primary star's density of $1.80\,{\rm
g\,cm}^{-3}$ (measured through the HIRES reconaissance spectroscopy).
However the stellar density measured from the transit fitting ($2.31
\pm 0.52\,{\rm g\,cm}^{-3}$) is only discrepant at the
$\approx$2-$\sigma$ level from the M-dwarf blend scenario.  It is
instead the combination of the flux contrast, transit depth, and
ingress duration that rule out this scenario.
