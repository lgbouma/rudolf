\begin{abstract}
  Kepler\,1627A is a G8V star previously found to host a
  $3.6\,R_\oplus$ mini-Neptune on a 7.2\,day orbit.  The star was
  selected for observation by the Kepler satellite because it is
  nearby ($d\approx 333\,{\rm pc}$) and resembles the Sun.  Combining
  data from Gaia with rotation periods from TESS, we show that
  Kepler\,1627 is a member of the $35\pm XX$\,Myr old $\delta$~Lyr
  cluster.  Our analysis advances Kepler\,1627Ab as the youngest
  planet with a precise age found by the main Kepler mission.
  Analyzing the photometry, we find evidence that starspot crossings
  {\it i)} distort the average transit shape, and {\it ii)} induce
  transit timing variations that suggest the planet is on a prograde
  orbit.  The possibility that star-planet interactions could induce
  flares in the system is also explored.  Future spectroscopic studies
  of \pn\ may help clarify the early evolution of the orbit and
  atmosphere for this mini-Neptune.  More generally, the merging of
  Gaia and TESS data offers an opportunity to significantly expand the
  census of age-dated planets; we provide a literature concatenation
  of young stars to support this effort.

\section{Manuscript}

While thousands of exoplanets have been discovered orbiting nearby
stars, the vast majority of them are several billion years old.  This
results in difficulty testing theories for the origins of the
different families of planets, since many expected evolutionary
processes operate on timescales of less than 100 million years.  

For instance, the ``mini-Neptune'' planets, thought to be made of
molten rocky cores and extended atmospheric envelopes of hydrogen and
helium, are expected to shrink in size by factors of several over
their first $10^8$ years \citep{owen_constraining_2020}.
Specifically, they start with sizes of 4--12\,$R_\oplus$ at the time
of disk dispersal ($\approx$$10^7$\,years), and shrink to sizes of
2--4\,$R_\oplus$ by 10$^8$ years.  This change is driven by a
combination of stellar irradiation and internal heat that powers an
outflow, which eventually depletes or entirely strips the envelope
from the rocky core \citep{Owen_Wu_2013,gupta_sculpting_2019}.
Discovering young planets and measuring their compositions and
atmospheric outflows are key steps toward testing this paradigm, which
is often invoked to explain the observed radius distribution of both
mature exoplanets \citep{Fulton_et_al_2017}, as well as younger
planets \citep{bouma_cluster_2020}.

% The orbits of the planets can also change early on, and can become
% significantly misaligned from the equators of their host stars.
% Measurements of the sky-projected angle between the planet orbit and
% the stellar spin (the stellar obliquity) have shown that high
% obliquities characterize hot field stars hosting both hot Jupiters and
% smaller planets \citep{winn10,louden21}.  Conversely, the obliquities
% of planets around cool stars tend to be low, but this could be due to
% tidal realignment \citep[{\it e.g.},][]{anderson21}.  Obliquity
% measurements for young planets are therefore important, because they
% provide an unobstructed view of the primordial obliquity distribution.

At the time of the main Kepler mission (2009--2013), only four open
clusters were known in the Kepler field: NGC\,6866, NGC\,6811,
NGC\,6819, and NGC\,6791, with ages spanning 0.7\,Gyr to 9\,Gyr
\citep{meibom_kepler_2011}.  Since that time, analyses of the
kinematic, photometric, and astrometric Gaia data have expanded our
knowledge of open cluster and moving group memberships \citep[{\it
e.g.},][]{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018,zari_3d_2018,kounkel_untangling_2019,Meingast2021}.
As part of our Cluster Difference Imaging Photometric Survey (CDIPS,
\citealt{bouma_cdipsI_2019}), we concatenated the available analyses
from the literature, which yielded a list of candidate young and
age-dated stars (see Section~\ref{app:targetlist}).

Comparing our young star list against the Kepler field yielded two
discoveries.  The first, to be discussed in an upcoming analysis
by J. Curtis et al{.}, is that Kepler observed the $\approx$350\,Myr
open cluster Theia\,520 (UBC\,1).  At least five Kepler planets are
known in the cluster, including the Kepler-52 and Kepler-968 systems.
The second discovery, and the focus of this work, is that Kepler
observed a portion of the $\delta$\,Lyr cluster, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:skychart}.

While we have yet to perform an in-depth planet search of the {\bf
XXX} light curves Kepler acquired for the \cn, there is already a
known planet in the cluster: Kepler\,1627b.  Given the
planet's previous statistical validation by \citet{morton_false_2016},
we decided to examine the age of the star and its cluster more closely.
We collected the previously measured {\bf XXX} Kepler
rotation periods (CITEP MCQUILLAN2014), and measured {\bf YYY} new stellar
rotation periods for cluster members observed by TESS.
We also performed an isochronal analysis.
The results are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:age}.
From the ensemble perspective, which provides the strongest
constraints (SEE CITET SODERBLOM 2014),
the age of the star is $XX \pm YY$\,Myr.
Individual measurements of the star's rotation period and lithium
abundance corroborate this conclusion.

If the Kepler\,1627b transit signal is created by a bonafide planet,
this age would make it the youngest planet yet found by the main
Kepler mission.  A portion of the light curve is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:lightcurve}, and the phase-folded transit is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:phasefold}.  The dominant signal in the
\texttt{PDCSAP} photometry is a quasi-period starspot signal with a
peak-to-peak amplitude that varies between roughly 2\% and 8\%,
depending on the degree of asymmetry in spot coverage between the
stellar hemispheres.  The starspot signal repeats roughly every
2.606\,days, though this value varies by a few percent depending on
which portion of the light curve is analyzed {\bf (FIXME: do!)}.  The
details of how we model this signal to derive the parameters of the
planet are discussed in Section~\ref{app:gptransit}.  The results,
given in Table~\ref{tab:posterior}, are consistent with a mini-Neptune
sized planet ($3.56\pm 0.04\,R_\oplus$) on a circular 7.2\,day orbit,
around a G8V star ($0.91 \pm 0.05 R_\odot$) {\bf fixme: age}. 

Could the transit signal be produced by anything other than a planet
orbiting this near-solar analog?  \citet{morton_false_2016} considered
the false positive scenarios of a foreground
eclipsing binary, a hierarchical triple-star binary system, and a
background eclipsing binary.  \citet{morton_false_2016} reported the
latter scenario to be the only possible case, with a (model-dependent)
probability of $\approx10^{-5}$.  While this statistical validation is
reassuring, ``validated'' planets have been demonstrated to be false
positives \citep{shporer_three_2017}.  Most failures of the
statistical validation approach arise when attempting to separate the
smallest stars from identically-sized gas giant planets.  With a size
of $\approx 3.6\,R_\oplus$, Kepler\,1627b does not meet this
concern.
The fact that we detect a low-mass stellar companion in
archival Keck-NIRC2 Kp-band (2.12\,$\mu $m) imaging does not change
the conclusion: the companion contributes 1\% of the flux
observed by Kepler, which combined with the observed transit shape
cannot be invoked as an explanation for the observed data
(Section~\ref{app:companionstar}).

Two additional lines of evidence ultimately persuaded us in favor of
the planetary interpretation.  First, the $\approx$100 days of
1-minute short-cadence data enables a more precise measurement of the
transit impact parameter: {\bf todo numbers} it is constrained to be
$<0.62$ (3-$\sigma$) from the 1-minute cadenced data, compared to
$<0.XX$ (3-$\sigma$) from the 30-minute data.  The second, and
ultimately convincing line of evidence came from our transit timing
analysis.  {\bf todo: KM pls check numbers} We isolated each of the
144 observed transits to within $\pm4.5$\,hr of each transit, and
fitted each window with both {\it i)} a local second-order polynomial
and transit, and {\it ii)} a local linear trend.  We let the mid-time
of each transit float, and then calculated the residual between the
measured mid-time and that of a perfectly periodic orbit.  This
residual, the ``transit timing variation'' (TTV), is plotted in
Figure~\ref{fig:ttvslope} against the local linear slope.  Only a
handful of Kepler Objects of Interest have shown this correlation
\citep{holczer_time_2015}, which is most readily interpreted as a TTV
induced by unresolved starspot crossings \citep{mazeh_time_2015}.  
This is of course only possible if the planet is transiting the
primary star, which excludes the any of the aforementioned false
positive scenarios.
It also implies that the planet's orbit is prograde.  The latter
interpretation assumes that the dominant
photometric variability is induced by dark spots, rather than bright
faculae.  Given the observed transition of Sun-like stellar
variability from spot to faculae-dominated regimes, we expect this
inference to be reasonably secure
\citep{shapiro_are_2016,montet_long-term_2017,reinhold_stellar_2020}.

    The time of each transit was measured, along with the local linear
    slope.  The two quantities are anti-correlated, which is most
    easily explained by starspot crossings during the first
    (second) half of transit inducing a positive (negative) TTV,
    provided that the orbit is prograde \citep{mazeh_time_2015}.

In short, Kepler\,1627Ab provides an interesting extremum in the ages
of the Kepler planets, and opens multiple avenues for study from the
ground.  Observations of its Doppler transit ($\Delta v_{\rm RM}
\approx 20$\ms) with HIRES or the upcoming KPF spectrograph could
yield a quantification of the stellar obliquity, and a means for
verifying the suggestion of a prograde order from transit timing
(CITEP,CITEP).  Similar transit spectroscopy aimed at detecting either
hydrogen or helium absorption could yield insight into the planet's
atmosphere, which is expected to be outflowing at a rate of {\bf
X.X}\,$M_\oplus\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ (CITE).  A more challenging
measurement would be a measurement of the planet's mass, through
either detailed timing analyses of the Kepler data, or through a
high-cadence multi-color radial velocity campaign.  The mass would
yield constraints on both the planet's composition (``what is the
extent of the initial gaseous envelope for a typical mini-Neptune?''),
as well as its initial entropy (``hot'' or ``cold''? CITE).

The precision of the Kepler data itself may enable more detailed
analyses without even needing to acquire more data.  While our transit
timing study did not yield the detection of any clearly significant
planet-induced TTVs, the star's flaring may be suggestive of
star-planet interactions.  Appendix REFERENCE highlights an odd flare
timing coincidence that may be worthy of further examination.  

Ultimately though, our age measurement for \pn\ was enabled
by identifying its connection to the \cn\ through the Gaia data.  The
Supplementary Table~\ref{tab:v05} enables similar crossmatches to
already known planets, as well as forthcoming planets from the TESS
mission (CITE RickerJATIS2014).  An alternative approach also likely
to bear fruit is to identify kinematic associations around exoplanet
host stars using the Gaia data, and to then verify these associations
with ancilliary rotation periods and spectroscopy (CITEP Tofflemire).

\section{Young, Age-Dated, and Age-Dateable Star Compilation}
\label{app:targetlist}

\input{t1_appendix.tex}
\input{t2_appendix.tex}

The \texttt{v0.5} CDIPS target catalog (Table~\ref{tab:v05}) includes
some important updates from previous versions.  As in
\citet{bouma_cdipsI_2019}, we collected membership information for
young, age-dated, or age-dateable stars from across the literature.
Table~\ref{tab:metadata} gives a list of the sources included, and
some brief summary statistics.

The first major important change is that the extent of analyses
performed on the Gaia data at the time of our compilation was wide and
deep enough that we opted to neglect pre-Gaia analyses, except in
cases for which spectroscopically confirmed samples of stars had been
collected.  The membership lists for instance of
\citet{Kharchenko_et_al_2013} and \citet{dias_proper_2014} (MWSC and
DAML) were no longer required, especially given their relatively high
field-star contamination rates compared to Gaia-derived membership
catalogs.

For any of the catalogs for which Gaia DR2 identifiers were not
immediately available, we either followed the spatial (plus
proper-motion) crossmatching procedures described in
\citet{bouma_cdipsI_2019}, or else we pulled the Gaia DR2 source
identifiers associated with the catalog from SIMBAD.  We consequently
opted to drop the $\texttt{ext\_catalog\_name}$ and $\texttt{dist}$
columns maintained in \citet{bouma_cdipsI_2019}, as these were only
populated for a small number of stars.

The most crucial parameters of a given star for our purposes are the
Gaia DR2 source identifier ($\texttt{source\_id}$), the cluster name
($\texttt{cluster}$), and the ($\texttt{age}$).  Given the
hierarchical nature of many stellar associations, we do not attempt to
resolve the cluster names to a single unique string.  The Orion
complex for instance, can be divided into almost one hundred kinematic
subgroups \citep{kounkel_apogee2_2018}.  Similar complexity applies to
the problem of determining homogeneous ages, which we do not attempt
to resolve.  Instead, we simply merged the cluster names and ages
reported by various authors together.

This means that our ``age'' column can be null, for cases in which the
original authors did not report an age, and a reference literature age
was not readily available.  Nonetheless, since we do generally prefer
stars with known ages, we made a few additional efforts to populate
this column.  When available, the age provenance is from the original
analysis of the cluster.  However, in a few cases we adopted other
ages when the string-based crossmatches on the ``cluster'' name was
straightforward.  In particular, we used the ages determined by
\citet{CantatGaudin2020b} to assign ages to the catalogs from
\citet{GaiaCollaboration2018}, \citet{CantatGaudin2018a},
\citet{CastroGinard2020}, and \citet{CantatGaudin2020a}.

The catalogs we included for which ages were not immediately available
were those of \citet{CottenSong2016}, \citet{Oh2017},
\citet{Zari2018}, \citet{Gagne2018a},
\citet{Gagne2018b},\citet{Gagne2018c}, and \citet{Ujjwal2020}.  While
in principle the moving group members discussed by
\citet{Gagne2018a,Gagne2018b,Gagne2018c} and \citet{Ujjwal2020} have
easily associated ages, our SIMBAD cross-matching lost the moving
group association from those studies, which should therefore be
recovered tools such as BANYAN
$\Sigma$.\footnote{\url{http://www.exoplanetes.umontreal.ca/banyan/banyansigma.php}}.
We also included the SIMBAD object identifiers $\texttt{TT*}$,
$\texttt{Y*O}, $\texttt{Y*?}, $\texttt{TT?}$, and $\texttt{pMS*}$.
Finally, we also included every star in the NASA Exoplanet Archive
$\texttt{ps}$ table that had a Gaia identifier available
\citep{NASAExoArchive_ps_20210506}.  If the age had finite
uncertainties, we also included it, since stellar ages determined
through the combination of isochrone-fitting and transit-derived
stellar densities typically have higher precision than from isochrones
alone.

The technical manipulations for the merging, cleaning, and joining
were performed using $\texttt{pandas}$
\citep{mckinney-proc-scipy-2010}.  The eventual crossmatch (using the
Gaia DR2 $\texttt{source\_id}$) against the Gaia DR2 archive was performed
asychronously on the Gaia archive
website\footnote{\url{https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/}}.

\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{fig:XYZvtang} shows members of the \cn\
reported
by \citet{kounkel_untangling_2019} to be in the group.
Galactic positions are determined and plotted only for stars with parallax
signal-to-noise exceeding 20.
The location of the Sun is shown on the plots.
The non-uniform ``clumps'' might be
an artifact of the data processing steps performed by \citet{kounkel_untangling_2019}.
We therefore only consider stars in the immediate kinematic group
around \sn. 
The tangential velocities relative to \sn\ are shown in the bottom right panel.
These are computed by assuming that every star has the same three-dimensional
spatial velocity as \sn, where we assume a systemic radial velocity of
$-16.7 \pm 0.2$\,\kms\ based on the reconnaissance spectra obtained by
A.~Howard on HIRES and D.~Latham on TRES.
The relevant projection effects are then taken into account,
as discussed by {\it e.g.}, \citet{Meingast2021} and {\bf L.~Bouma et al (2021, submitted)}.



\section{Transit and Stellar Variability Model}

\end{figure*}



We assumed a quadratic limb-darkening law, with the uninformative prior
advocated by CITET Kipping2013.

% In the first approach, we adopted uniform priors centered on the
% interpolated CITET Claret+2011 coefficients in the Kepler-band, with
% with $\pm 0.2$ in either parameter.  The fit was not as good.

Our default stellar variability model (RotGPtransit) allows for a
\texttt{RotTerm} GP kernel, with a logjitter term to inflate the
uncertainties to account for excess white noise.  (This results in an
inflation of the uncertainties by a factor of about three).

We considered including an additive \texttt{SHOTerm} kernel to account
for stochastic noise (RotStochGPtransit).  This didn't seem to affect
the results much, so we opted for the simpler model.

Figure~\ref{fig:phasefold} shows X, Y, Z.  The residuals during the
transit may hint at some small degree of unfitted signal -- in the
sense that the observations are systematically high in the first half
of transit, and low in the second half.  This is the phase of maximal
scatter during each orbital period (TODO: in vs out of transit
scatter).  The amplitude of the anomaly is $\approx$30\,ppm.

To explore the origin of the anomaly, we binned the Kepler data over
quarters (Figure~\ref{fig:phasequarter}) and years
(Figure~\ref{fig:phaseyear}).  In Figure~\ref{fig:phasequarter}
Quarter 6 shows the strongest asymmetry out of any of the quarters: a
deviation of about 3\,ppt from expectation.  Quarter 7 shows an
anomaly at roughly the same transit phase.  Year 2 correspondingly
shows the strongest anomaly out of any year in
Figure~\ref{fig:phaseyear}.

We considered three possible explanations for the anomaly: gravity
darkening, transit timing variations, and spot-crossing events.

Gravity darkening (e.g., CITE Masuda 2015) is based on the premise
that the rapidly rotating star becomes oblate, and brighter near the
poles than the equator.  The fractional shape change due to gravity
darkening is on the order of $(P_{\rm break}/P_{\rm rot})^2$, for
$P_{\rm break}$ the break-up rotation period, and $P_{\rm rot}$ the
rotation period.  Using the parameters from Table~\ref{tab:posterior},
this yields an expected 1.6\% distortion of the $\approx$1.8\,ppt
transit depth: {\it i.e.}, an absolute deviation of $\approx$3\,ppm.
This is smaller than the observed anomaly by an order of magnitude,
and therefore seems unlikely.

The scenario of transit timing variations (TTVs) producing the
asymmetry seems unlikely, since the analysis by
\citet{holczer_transit_2016} implies that any such variations in \sn\
need to be less than of order minutes.  Figures~\ref{fig:phasequarter}
and~\ref{fig:phaseyear} also provide little evidence in support of
this possibility.

The final possibility is that of starspot crossings.  Given the high
expected spot-covering fractions for young stars ({\it e.g.},
\citealt{morris_relationship_2020}, \citealt{plavchan_planet_2020}),
\pn\ may cross spot groups on the stellar surface in projection.
Spot-crossing anomalies often reach amplitudes exceeding 100\,ppm
({\it e.g.}, CITE Dai 2018, maybe Southworth's recent stuff).  For our
system,  $P_{\rm orb}/P_{\rm rot} \approx 2.76$.  This means that
every 4 transits (and 11 stellar rotations), the planet crosses over
roughly the same stellar longitude.  Over a given quarter, this could
occur at most three times, assuming the spot groups are persistent.  

This could provide a plausible path to creating the distorted transit
signal, based on the amplitudes involved.  However, the typical S/N
per Kepler transit is $\approx8$, making individual spot-crossing
unresolved, and this scenario challenging to test.  {\it A priori},
one would also expect the spot-crossing events to not have a preferred
orbital phase, so that they would average out over the $\approx200$
Kepler transits.  Nonetheless, given the available data, it is our
best explanation for what we believe is real additional photometric
scatter observed during the transits.

\subsection{Short Cadence Data}

\begin{figure*}[t]

short cadence (1-minute) data acquired during Quarter 15.

\section{Flare Analysis}
\label{app:flare}

\begin{figure*}[t]

		\label{fig:flarezoom}
	}
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure*}[t]
	\begin{center}
		\leavevmode
		\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{f8.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\vspace{-0.7cm}
	\caption{
		{\bf Phase-folded flares in Kepler\,1627}.  
    {\it Top:}
    As in the middle of Figure~\ref{fig:flarezoom}, phase-folded at
    the planet's ephemeris.
    {\it Bottom:}
    Fitted flare amplitudes and orbital phases -- each point

    Colors indicate relative time, from the beginning of the

    yellow).
    Lower amplitude flares likely exist in the data, and were not
    examined.
		\label{fig:flarephase}
	}
\end{figure*}


The 1-minute cadence Kepler observations span 98 days, and cover 24
flares exceeding $0.5\%$ in relative flux.  These 24 flares spanned a
total of 6.5 hours ($\sim$15 minutes per flare).  The coincidence is
that despite the low flare duty cycle, one orbital period after the
brightest flare, a second flare followed.  This and a similar
event are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:flarezoom}.  The timing error is
good to a $\approx0.2\%$ difference from the orbital period, which
seems {\it a priori} unlikely.  If we consider flares falling within
2\% of the planet's orbital period after a previous flare, then 4 of
the 24 flare events have candidate ``successors''.

A brief note on how we cleaned the light curve, and identified the
flares.
For cleaning, we performed the following iterative detrending procedure.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Step 1: Build a two-term mixed SHOTerm GP model with
    quasi-periodic kernels at Prot and 0.5$\times$Prot. Fit the model
    to the time, flux, and flux uncertainty.
  \item Step 2: Select points more than twice the median absolute
    deviation from the residual, and exclude them from the light
    curve.  Repeat Step 1.
  \item Step 3: On the residual from Step 2, identify all flares,
    requiring them to be at least 20 cadences apart, at least 7 median
    absolute deviations above the median baseline, and lasting at least
    2 cadences in duration.  Build the mask spanning these times, from
    5 minutes before each flare begins to 2.5 minutes after the final
    flare cadence.  Repeat Step 1 a final time.
\end{itemize}

The flares were identified and fitted using ALTAIPONY (CITE CITE).
The fitted model is that of CITE XXX, which parametrizes the flare
with a start time, a lag time, and an amplitude (CHECK).
Figure~\ref{fig:flarephase} shows the resulting flares, amplitudes,
and phases.

We considered two hypotheses: {\it i)} the flare arrival times are
distributed as a Poisson process, and {\it ii)} they are better
explained as a Poisson process with a periodic mixture component.

TODO: explore!  Fit the flare inter-arrival times...
[even the 2-separated ones?]





\section{Companion Star and False Positive Assessment}
\label{app:companionstar}

\begin{figure*}[t]

    variability, the high RUWE estimate suggests that Kepler\,1627A is
    a binary. 
		\label{fig:ruwe}
	}
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure*}[t]

    {\bf SCALEBAR DENOTES...}
    {\bf North is up, East is left}.
    \label{fig:ao}
	}
\end{figure*}

Our analysis of archival Keck-NIRC2 Kp-band (2.12\,$\mu $m) imaging
revealed the existence of a previously unreported stellar neighbor,
unresolved in the Gaia source catalog {\bf FIXME: uncertainties}.  The
NIRC2 images yield a projected separation $\rho=0\farcs17$, with
$\Delta {\rm Kp} = 2.5$.  Using the measured Gaia EDR3 parallax for
the system, this implies a projected separation of 54\,AU.  The
presence of this star is consistent with the excess noise in the Gaia
astrometric time-series (see Section~\ref{app:companionstar}).  Given
the low chance of a star imaged within {\bf X.X arcseconds} to be a
chance companion along the line of sight, we proceed under the
assumption that it is bound, and that the Kepler\,1627 system is
binary.

Unforuntately, we do not have any reliable color information about
Kepler\,1627B.  Based on the
tabulation\footnote{\url{http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/EEM_dwarf_UBVIJHK_colors_Teff.txt},
version \texttt{2021/03/02}.} by \citet{pecaut_mamajek_2013}, the
measured NIR-contrast for a main sequence G8V star corresponds to a
spectral type for the companion of $\approx$M2V ($M_\star \approx
0.44\,M_\odot$).  However, the companion should have a longer
pre-main-sequence contraction phase than the primary, which would
imply that this mass is overestimated by $\sim10$ to $20\%$.

Could the companion be creating a false positive signal?  The
companion star contributes $\approx$1\% of the total flux observed in
the Kepler aperture (0.7-2.0\% V-band to G-band dmag difference from
EEM table; todo is fix using model spectra).  The observed transit has
a depth of 0.18\%.  An 18\% deep eclipse of the secondary star would
therefore be needed to produce a deep enough signal.  The shape of the
observed signal requires allowed impact parameters to span 0.02 to
0.73 (Table~\ref{tab:posterior}); the body transiting the secondary
would therefore need to be non-grazing with $R_3/R_2 \approx 0.42$.
Assuming a $\approx 0.42R_\odot$ radius of the imaged secondary, this
would imply a tertiary stellar radius of $\approx 0.2R_\odot$.  This
scenario ultimately yields a contradiction, because it would require
an ingress and egress phase that each span $\approx$40\% of the
transit duration ($\approx 65\,{\rm minutes}$).  The actual measured
ingress and egress duration is $\approx 15\,{\rm minutes}$),
4.4$\times$ shorter.

\paragraph{Stellar density implied by transit duration}
The duration of the transit ($2.823 \pm 0.057 hr$) and the implied
stellar density ($2.31 \pm 0.52\,{\rm g\,cm}^{-3}$) could in theory
help rule between whether the transiting body orbits the primary or
secondary star.  Ultimately, our stellar density measurement is not
precise enough to render the blend scenario implausible.  At 30 Myr, a
0.40\,$M_\odot$ solar-metallicity dwarf is $\approx 26\%$ larger than
when it is fully contracted on the main sequence (0.40\,$R_\odot$
vs{.} 0.50\,$R_\odot$; CITEALT: Choi et al, MIST grids).  The
theoretically implied companion density of $3.2\,{\rm g\,cm}^{-3}$ is
indeed larger than the primary star's density of $1.80\,{\rm
g\,cm}^{-3}$ (measured through the HIRES reconaissance spectroscopy).
However the stellar density measured from the transit fitting ($2.31
\pm 0.52\,{\rm g\,cm}^{-3}$) is only discrepant at the
$\approx$2-$\sigma$ level from the M-dwarf blend scenario.  It is
instead the combination of the flux contrast, transit depth, and
ingress duration that rule out this scenario.
