\begin{abstract}
  Kepler\,1627A is a G8V star previously found to host a
  $3.6\,R_\oplus$ mini-Neptune on a 7.2\,day orbit.  The star was
  selected for observation by the Kepler satellite because it is
  nearby ($d\approx 333\,{\rm pc}$) and it resembles the Sun.  Combining
  data from Gaia with rotation periods from TESS, we show that
  Kepler\,1627 is a member of the $35\pm XX$\,Myr old $\delta$~Lyr
  cluster.  Kepler\,1627Ab is therefore the youngest planet with a
  precise age found to date by the main Kepler mission.
  Analyzing the photometry, we find evidence that starspot crossings
  distort the average transit shape, and induce transit timing
  variations that suggest the planet is on a prograde orbit.  The 
  flare arrival times may show hints of being
  non-Poissonian, but the statistical evidence is not overwhelming ($<3$-$\sigma$).  In the future,
  spectroscopic studies of \pn\ may help clarify the evolution of this
  mini-Neptune's orbit and atmosphere.  More broadly, the
  combination of Gaia and TESS data offers an opportunity to
  expand the census of age-dated planets; we provide a literature
  concatenation of young stars to support this effort.

\section{Manuscript}

While thousands of exoplanets have been discovered orbiting nearby
stars, the vast majority of them are several billion years old.  This
makes it difficult to test theories for the origins of the different
families of planets, since many evolutionary processes are expected to
operate on timescales of less than 100 million years.

For instance, the ``mini-Neptune'' planets, thought to be made of
molten rocky cores and extended atmospheric envelopes of hydrogen and
helium, are expected to shrink in size by factors of several over
their first $10^8$ years
\citep{owen_constraining_2020,kite_atmosphere_2020}.  Specifically,
they start with sizes of 4--12\,$R_\oplus$ at the time of disk
dispersal ($\lesssim$$10^7$\,years), and shrink to sizes of
2--4\,$R_\oplus$ by 10$^8$ years.  This change is driven by a
combination of stellar irradiation and internal heat that powers an
outflow, which can eventually deplete or entirely strip the envelope
from the rocky core \citep{Owen_Wu_2013,gupta_sculpting_2019}.
Discovering young planets and measuring their compositions and
atmospheric outflows are key steps toward testing this paradigm, which
is often invoked to explain the observed radius distribution of both
mature exoplanets \citep{Fulton_et_al_2017}, as well as younger
planets \citep{bouma_cluster_2020}.

% TODO: decide whether a paragraph about young planet obliquities is
% needed.

% The orbits of the planets can also change early on, and can become
% significantly misaligned from the equators of their host stars.
% Measurements of the sky-projected angle between the planet orbit and
% the stellar spin (the stellar obliquity) have shown that high
% obliquities characterize hot field stars hosting both hot Jupiters and
% smaller planets \citep{winn10,louden21}.  Conversely, the obliquities
% of planets around cool stars tend to be low, but this could be due to
% tidal realignment \citep[{\it e.g.},][]{anderson21}.  Obliquity
% measurements for young planets are therefore important, because they
% provide an unobstructed view of the primordial obliquity distribution.

At the time of the main Kepler mission (2009--2013), only four open
clusters were known in the Kepler field: NGC\,6866, NGC\,6811,
NGC\,6819, and NGC\,6791, with ages spanning 0.7\,Gyr to 9\,Gyr
\citep{meibom_kepler_2011}.  Since that time, analyses of the
kinematic, photometric, and astrometric Gaia data have expanded our
knowledge of open cluster and moving group memberships \citep[{\it
e.g.},][]{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018,zari_3d_2018,kounkel_untangling_2019,Meingast2021}.
As part of our Cluster Difference Imaging Photometric Survey (CDIPS,
\citealt{bouma_cdipsI_2019}), we concatenated the available analyses
from the literature, which yielded a list of candidate young and
age-dated stars (see Appendix~\ref{app:targetlist}).

Comparing our young star list against the Kepler field yielded two
discoveries.  The first, to be discussed in an upcoming analysis by J.
Curtis et al{.}, is that Kepler observed the $\approx$350\,Myr open
cluster Theia\,520 (UBC\,1).  At least six Kepler planets are known in
the cluster, from the Kepler-52 and Kepler-968 systems
\citep{rowe_validation_2014,jontof-hutter_following_2021}.  The second
discovery, and the focus of this work, is that Kepler observed a
portion of the $\delta$\,Lyr cluster, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:skychart}.

{\bf Jason Curtis todo}
The \cn\ contains
Kepler\,1627 (KIC 6184894; KOI 5245; TIC 120105470), which 
was previously reported to host a close-in mini-Neptune candidate planet
\citep{2012ApJS..199...24T,thompson_planetary_2018}
Given the planet's previous statistical validation by
\citet{morton_false_2016}, we decided to examine the age of the star
and its cluster more closely.  We collected the previously measured
{\bf XXX} Kepler rotation periods (CITEP MCQUILLAN2014), and measured
{\bf YYY} new stellar rotation periods for cluster members observed by
TESS.  We also performed an isochronal analysis.  The results are
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:age}.  From the ensemble perspective, which
provides the strongest constraints (SEE CITET SODERBLOM 2014), the age
of the star is $XX \pm YY$\,Myr.  Individual measurements of the
star's rotation period and lithium abundance corroborate this
conclusion.

% rotation period from plot_rotation_period_windowslider.py

If the \pn\ transit signal is created by a bonafide planet, this age
would make it the youngest planet yet found by the main Kepler
mission\footnote{The re-purposed K2 mission found two slightly younger
systems: K2-33b \citep{David_et_al_2017,Mann_K2_33b_2016} and V1298
Tau \citep{david_four_2019}}.  A portion of the light curve is shown
with the phase-folded transit
in Figure~\ref{fig:lc}.  The dominant signal in the
\texttt{PDCSAP} photometry is a quasi-period starspot signal with a
peak-to-peak amplitude that varies between roughly 2\% and 8\%,
depending on the degree of asymmetry in spot coverage between the
stellar hemispheres.  The starspot signal repeats every
$2.642\pm0.042$\,days, where we have adopted an uncertainty based on
the scatter observed between different portions (quarters) of the
time-series data.  The details of how we model this starspot signal to
derive the parameters of the planet are discussed in
Appendix~\ref{app:gptransit}.  The results, given in
Table~\ref{tab:posterior}, are consistent with a mini-Neptune sized
planet ($3.56\pm 0.04\,R_\oplus$) on a circular 7.2\,day orbit
($e<0.XX$), around a G8V star ($0.91 \pm 0.05 R_\odot$).  {\bf TODO
quote the eccentricity limit}

Could the transit signal be produced by anything other than a planet
orbiting this near-solar analog?  \citet{morton_false_2016} considered
the false positive scenarios of a foreground eclipsing binary, a
hierarchical triple-star binary system, and a background eclipsing
binary.  Based on the transit shape, \citet{morton_false_2016} found
the latter scenario to be the only possible case, with a
(model-dependent) probability of $\approx10^{-5}$.  While this
statistical validation is reassuring, ``validated'' planets have been
demonstrated to be false positives \citep{shporer_three_2017}.  Most
failures of the statistical validation approach arise when attempting
to separate the smallest stars from identically-sized gas giant
planets.  With a size of $\approx 3.6\,R_\oplus$, Kepler\,1627b does
not meet this concern.  The fact that we detect a low-mass stellar
companion in archival Keck-NIRC2 Kp-band (2.12\,$\mu $m) imaging does
not change the conclusion: the companion contributes 1\% of the flux
observed by Kepler, which combined with the observed transit shape
cannot be invoked as an explanation for the observed data
(Appendix~\ref{app:companionstar}).

{\bf todo: LGB to check numbers on full-dataset transit ecc and b} 
Two additional new lines of evidence support the planetary
interpretation.  First, the $\approx$100 days of 1-minute
short-cadence data reduces the cadence-induced smearing enables a more
precise measurement of the transit impact parameter
\citep{kipping_binning_2010}.  The planet transits with $b<0.YY$
(3-$\sigma$) from the 1-minute cadenced data, compared to $<0.XX$
(3-$\sigma$) from the 30-minute data.

{\bf todo: Kento to check numbers on per-transit analysis} 
The second line of evidence came from our transit timing analysis. We
isolated each of the 144 observed transits to within $\pm4.5$\,hr of
each transit, and fitted each window with both {\it i)} a local
second-order polynomial and transit, and {\it ii)} a local linear
trend.  We let the mid-time of each transit float, and then calculated
the residual between the measured mid-time and that of a perfectly
periodic orbit.  This residual, the ``transit timing variation''
(TTV), is plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:ttvslope} against the local
linear slope.  Only a handful of Kepler Objects of Interest have shown
this correlation \citep{holczer_time_2015}, which is most readily
interpreted as a TTV induced by unresolved starspot crossings
\citep{mazeh_time_2015}.  This is of course only possible if the
planet is transiting the primary star, which excludes the any of the
aforementioned false positive scenarios.  It also implies that the
planet's orbit is prograde.  The latter interpretation assumes that
the dominant photometric variability is induced by dark spots, rather
than bright faculae.  Given the observed transition of Sun-like
stellar variability from spot to faculae-dominated regimes, we expect
this inference to be reasonably secure
\citep{shapiro_are_2016,montet_long-term_2017,reinhold_stellar_2020}.

		{\bf Evidence for a prograde orbit from transit timing variations.}
    The time of each transit was measured, along with the local slope
    of the light curve.  The two quantities appear anti-correlated,
    which is most easily explained by starspot crossings during the
    first (second) half of transit inducing a positive (negative) TTV,
    provided that the orbit is prograde \citep{mazeh_time_2015}.  The
    units along the abscissa are most easily understood by considering
    that the flux from the star changes by $\sim$60\,ppt per half
    rotation period ($\sim$1.3\,days).

{\bf LGB TODO: ask James Owen what he thinks the mass loss rate is}
Kepler\,1627Ab therefore provides a new extremum in the ages of the
Kepler planets, and opens multiple avenues for study from the ground.
Observations of its Doppler transit are expected to induce a
Rossiter-McLaughlin anomaly with an amplitude of $\approx 20$\ms, and
could yield a quantification of the stellar obliquity, and a means for
verifying our transit-timing based suggestion of a prograde orbit.
Similar transit spectroscopy aimed at detecting either hydrogen or
helium absorption could yield insight into the planet's atmosphere,
which is expected to be outflowing at a rate of {\bf
X.X}\,$M_\oplus\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ (CITE).  A more challenging
measurement would be a measurement of the planet's mass, through
either detailed timing analyses of the Kepler data, or through a
high-cadence multi-color radial velocity campaign.  The mass could
yield constraints on both the planet's composition as well as its
initial entropy \citep{owen_constraining_2020}.

The precision of the Kepler data itself may enable more detailed
analyses without needing to acquire more data.  While our transit
timing study did not yield the detection of any clearly significant
planet-planet induced TTVs, the star's flaring may be suggestive of
star-planet interactions.  Appendix~\ref{app:flare} highlights an odd
flare timing coincidence that may be worthy of further examination.

    \pn\ is shown with a star.
    The abnormally large radii of the youngest transiting planets
    could be explained by their primordial atmospheres not yet
    having evaporated.

    Parameters were acquired from the NASA Exoplanet Archive on July
    2, 2021.
		\label{fig:rp_period_age}

\end{figure*}

In the context of the known transiting planets, \pn\ is among the
youngest known (Figure~\ref{fig:rp_period_age}).  Comparable systems
with precisely measured ages spanning 10 to 100\,Myr include K2-33b,
DS~Tuc~Ab, HIP~67522b, TOI~837b, AU~Mic~b, and the four-planet
V1298~Tau system
\citep{Mann_K2_33b_2016,David_et_al_2017,newton_tess_2019,david_four_2019,bouma_cluster_2020,plavchan_planet_2020}.
Of these systems, \pn\ inhabits a similar range of planetary size and
orbital period.  It is the smallest though ($3.6\,R_\oplus$), which
may hint at selection effects in the sample of young planets
\citep{zhou_2021_tois}.  Assuming that these planets have masses
between $\approx$10 and 20$\,M_\oplus$, their large sizes and presumed
low densities are in accord with the expectation that mini-Neptunes
start their lives with large primordial atmopsheres that are are lost
over the first gigayear
\citep{Owen_Wu_2013,Fulton_et_al_2017,ginzburg_core-powered_2018}.
The observation from starspot-induced TTVs that the planetary orbit
could be aligned with the stellar spin differs from a number of other
close-in
mini-Neptunes~\citep{sanchis-ojeda_starspots_2011,albrecht_obliquities_2012,dalal_2019_hd3167,rubenzahl_tess-keck_2021}.
Overall however, it is consistent with a quiescent disk-driven
migration history for the planet, while the in-situ formation scenario
is disfavored because the necessary disk mass would always drive
planets to migrate
\citep{inamdar_formation_2015,ogihara_reassessment_2015}.


Ultimately, our age measurement for \pn\ was enabled by identifying
its connection to the \cn\ using the Gaia data.  The Supplementary
Table~\ref{tab:v05} enables similar crossmatches to already known
planets, as well as forthcoming planets from the TESS mission
\citep{ricker_transiting_2015,guerrero_tess_2021}.  An alternative
approach would be to identify kinematic associations around exoplanet
host stars using the Gaia data, and to then verify these associations
with ancilliary rotation periods and spectroscopy
\citep{tofflemire_tess_2021}.

\section{Young, Age-Dated, and Age-Dateable Star Compilation}
\label{app:targetlist}

\input{t1_appendix.tex}
\input{t2_appendix.tex}

The \texttt{v0.5} CDIPS target catalog (Table~\ref{tab:v05}) includes
some important updates from previous versions.  As in
\citet{bouma_cdipsI_2019}, we collected membership information for
young, age-dated, or age-dateable stars from across the literature.
Table~\ref{tab:metadata} gives a list of the sources included, and
some brief summary statistics.

The first major important change is that the extent of analyses
performed on the Gaia data at the time of our compilation was wide and
deep enough that we opted to neglect pre-Gaia analyses, except in
cases for which spectroscopically confirmed samples of stars had been
collected.  The membership lists for instance of
\citet{Kharchenko_et_al_2013} and \citet{dias_proper_2014} (MWSC and
DAML) were no longer required, especially given their relatively high
field-star contamination rates compared to Gaia-derived membership
catalogs.

For any of the catalogs for which Gaia DR2 identifiers were not
immediately available, we either followed the spatial (plus
proper-motion) crossmatching procedures described in
\citet{bouma_cdipsI_2019}, or else we pulled the Gaia DR2 source
identifiers associated with the catalog from SIMBAD.  We consequently
opted to drop the $\texttt{ext\_catalog\_name}$ and $\texttt{dist}$
columns maintained in \citet{bouma_cdipsI_2019}, as these were only
populated for a small number of stars.

The most crucial parameters of a given star for our purposes are the
Gaia DR2 source identifier ($\texttt{source\_id}$), the cluster name
($\texttt{cluster}$), and the ($\texttt{age}$).  Given the
hierarchical nature of many stellar associations, we do not attempt to
resolve the cluster names to a single unique string.  The Orion
complex for instance, can be divided into almost one hundred kinematic
subgroups \citep{kounkel_apogee2_2018}.  Similar complexity applies to
the problem of determining homogeneous ages, which we do not attempt
to resolve.  Instead, we simply merged the cluster names and ages
reported by various authors together.

This means that our ``age'' column can be null, for cases in which the
original authors did not report an age, and a reference literature age
was not readily available.  Nonetheless, since we do generally prefer
stars with known ages, we made a few additional efforts to populate
this column.  When available, the age provenance is from the original
analysis of the cluster.  However, in a few cases we adopted other
ages when the string-based crossmatches on the ``cluster'' name was
straightforward.  In particular, we used the ages determined by
\citet{CantatGaudin2020b} to assign ages to the catalogs from
\citet{GaiaCollaboration2018}, \citet{CantatGaudin2018a},
\citet{CastroGinard2020}, and \citet{CantatGaudin2020a}.

The catalogs we included for which ages were not immediately available
were those of \citet{CottenSong2016}, \citet{Oh2017},
\citet{Zari2018}, \citet{Gagne2018a},
\citet{Gagne2018b},\citet{Gagne2018c}, and \citet{Ujjwal2020}.  While
in principle the moving group members discussed by
\citet{Gagne2018a,Gagne2018b,Gagne2018c} and \citet{Ujjwal2020} have
easily associated ages, our SIMBAD cross-matching lost the moving
group association from those studies, which should therefore be
recovered tools such as BANYAN
$\Sigma$.\footnote{\url{http://www.exoplanetes.umontreal.ca/banyan/banyansigma.php}}.
We also included the SIMBAD object identifiers $\texttt{TT*}$,
$\texttt{Y*O}, $\texttt{Y*?}, $\texttt{TT?}$, and $\texttt{pMS*}$.
Finally, we also included every star in the NASA Exoplanet Archive
$\texttt{ps}$ table that had a Gaia identifier available
\citep{NASAExoArchive_ps_20210506}.  If the age had finite
uncertainties, we also included it, since stellar ages determined
through the combination of isochrone-fitting and transit-derived
stellar densities typically have higher precision than from isochrones
alone.

The technical manipulations for the merging, cleaning, and joining
were performed using $\texttt{pandas}$
\citep{mckinney-proc-scipy-2010}.  The eventual crossmatch (using the
Gaia DR2 $\texttt{source\_id}$) against the Gaia DR2 archive was performed
asychronously on the Gaia archive
website\footnote{\url{https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/}}.

\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{fig:XYZvtang} shows members of the \cn\
reported
by \citet{kounkel_untangling_2019} to be in the group.
Galactic positions are determined and plotted only for stars with parallax
signal-to-noise exceeding 20.
The location of the Sun is shown on the plots.
The non-uniform ``clumps'' might be
an artifact of the data processing steps performed by \citet{kounkel_untangling_2019}.
We therefore only consider stars in the immediate kinematic group
around \sn. 
The tangential velocities relative to \sn\ are shown in the bottom right panel.
These are computed by assuming that every star has the same three-dimensional
spatial velocity as \sn, where we assume a systemic radial velocity of
$-16.7 \pm 0.2$\,\kms\ based on the reconnaissance spectra obtained by
A.~Howard on HIRES and D.~Latham on TRES.
The relevant projection effects are then taken into account,
as discussed by {\it e.g.}, \citet{Meingast2021} and {\bf L.~Bouma et al (2021, submitted)}.

\end{figure*}



We assumed a quadratic limb-darkening law, with the uninformative prior
advocated by CITET Kipping2013.

% In the first approach, we adopted uniform priors centered on the
% interpolated CITET Claret+2011 coefficients in the Kepler-band, with
% with $\pm 0.2$ in either parameter.  The fit was not as good.

Our default stellar variability model (RotGPtransit) allows for a
\texttt{RotTerm} GP kernel, with a logjitter term to inflate the
uncertainties to account for excess white noise.  (This results in an
inflation of the uncertainties by a factor of about three).

We considered including an additive \texttt{SHOTerm} kernel to account
for stochastic noise (RotStochGPtransit).  This didn't seem to affect
the results much, so we opted for the simpler model.

Figure~\ref{fig:phasefold} shows X, Y, Z.  The residuals during the
transit may hint at some small degree of unfitted signal -- in the
sense that the observations are systematically high in the first half
of transit, and low in the second half.  This is the phase of maximal
scatter during each orbital period (TODO: in vs out of transit
scatter).  The amplitude of the anomaly is $\approx$30\,ppm.

To explore the origin of the anomaly, we binned the Kepler data over
quarters (Figure~\ref{fig:phasequarter}) and years
(Figure~\ref{fig:phaseyear}).  In Figure~\ref{fig:phasequarter}
Quarter 6 shows the strongest asymmetry out of any of the quarters: a
deviation of about 3\,ppt from expectation.  Quarter 7 shows an
anomaly at roughly the same transit phase.  Year 2 correspondingly
shows the strongest anomaly out of any year in
Figure~\ref{fig:phaseyear}.

We considered three possible explanations for the anomaly: gravity
darkening, transit timing variations, and spot-crossing events.

Gravity darkening (e.g., CITE Masuda 2015) is based on the premise
that the rapidly rotating star becomes oblate, and brighter near the
poles than the equator.  The fractional shape change due to gravity
darkening is on the order of $(P_{\rm break}/P_{\rm rot})^2$, for
$P_{\rm break}$ the break-up rotation period, and $P_{\rm rot}$ the
rotation period.  Using the parameters from Table~\ref{tab:posterior},
this yields an expected 1.6\% distortion of the $\approx$1.8\,ppt
transit depth: {\it i.e.}, an absolute deviation of $\approx$3\,ppm.
This is smaller than the observed anomaly by an order of magnitude,
and therefore seems unlikely.

The scenario of transit timing variations (TTVs) producing the
asymmetry seems unlikely, since the analysis by
\citet{holczer_transit_2016} implies that any such variations in \sn\
need to be less than of order minutes.  Figures~\ref{fig:phasequarter}
and~\ref{fig:phaseyear} also provide little evidence in support of
this possibility.

The final possibility is that of starspot crossings.  Given the high
expected spot-covering fractions for young stars ({\it e.g.},
\citealt{morris_relationship_2020}, \citealt{plavchan_planet_2020}),
\pn\ may cross spot groups on the stellar surface in projection.
Spot-crossing anomalies often reach amplitudes exceeding 100\,ppm
({\it e.g.}, CITE Dai 2018, maybe Southworth's recent stuff).  For our
system,  $P_{\rm orb}/P_{\rm rot} \approx 2.76$.  This means that
every 4 transits (and 11 stellar rotations), the planet crosses over
roughly the same stellar longitude.  Over a given quarter, this could
occur at most three times, assuming the spot groups are persistent.  

This could provide a plausible path to creating the distorted transit
signal, based on the amplitudes involved.  However, the typical S/N
per Kepler transit is $\approx8$, making individual spot-crossing
unresolved, and this scenario challenging to test.  {\it A priori},
one would also expect the spot-crossing events to not have a preferred
orbital phase, so that they would average out over the $\approx200$
Kepler transits.  Nonetheless, given the available data, it is our
best explanation for what we believe is real additional photometric
scatter observed during the transits.

    24 flares were recorded with amplitudes exceeding 0.5\% over the

    time intervals between every possible pair of flares is shown in
    black.  Some plausibly important timescales for star-planet

    with the gray bands.  While peaks in the observed distribution do

    statistical evidence for a non-Poissonian process driving the
    flares does not reach the $5$-$\sigma$ threshold.
		\label{fig:flarestats}
	}
\end{figure*}

The short cadence (1-minute) Kepler observations span 97.7 days.
The light curve shows a significant number of flares
(Figure~\ref{fig:flarezoom}).
To quantify clean the light curve and identify the flares, we
performed the following procedure.
For cleaning, we performed the following iterative detrending procedure.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Step 1: Build a two-term mixed SHOTerm GP model with
    quasi-periodic kernels at Prot and 0.5$\times$Prot. Fit the model
    to the time, flux, and flux uncertainty.
  \item Step 2: Select points more than twice the median absolute
    deviation from the residual, and exclude them from the light
    curve.  Repeat Step 1.
  \item Step 3: On the residual from Step 2, identify all flares,
    requiring them to be at least 20 cadences apart, at least 7 median
    absolute deviations above the median baseline, and lasting at least
    2 cadences in duration.  Build the mask spanning these times, from
    5 minutes before each flare begins to 2.5 minutes after the final
    flare cadence.  Repeat Step 1 a final time.
\end{itemize}
The flares were then identified and fitted using ALTAIPONY (CITE CITE).
The fitted model is that of CITE XXX, which parametrizes the flare
with a start time, a lag time, and an amplitude (CHECK).
Figure~\ref{fig:flarephase} shows the resulting flares, amplitudes,
and phases.

There were $N_{\rm f}=24$ flares exceeding $0.5\%$ in relative flux during the
short-cadence observations.  These 24 flares spanned a total of 6.5
hours ($\sim$15 minutes per flare).  For better or worse, we noticed a
coincidence in the flare arrival times.  The coincidence is that
despite the low flare duty cycle, one orbital period after the
brightest flare, a second flare followed.  This and a similar event
are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:flarezoom}.  The timing error is good to
a $\approx0.2\%$ difference from the orbital period, which seems {\it
a priori} unlikely.  If we consider flares falling within 2\% of the
planet's orbital period after a previous flare, then 4 of the 24 flare
events have candidate ``successors''.

As with any coincidence, when one does not have a firm prediction, it
is difficult to assess the statistical significance of a surprise.
Since our surprise was specifically at the inter-arrival time of
certain flares coinciding with special time intervals, we performed
the following analysis.  First, we considered all unordered pairs of
flares.  For $N$ flares there are ${n \choose 2}$ such pairs (for our
case, 276 pairs).  We then compared the distribution of the pair
separations against that from a Poisson distribution.  Specifically,
we drew $N_{\rm f}=24$ samples from a Poisson distribution with
$\lambda = \Delta t / N_{\rm f}$, for $\Delta t=97.7\,{\rm days}$ the
duration of the observations, and repeated the draw $10^3$ times with
unique random seeds.

Figure~\ref{fig:flarestats} shows the results.  The vertical lines in
the figure show the planetary orbital period, the synodic period
$P_{\rm syn} = (P_{\rm rot}^{-1} - P_{\rm orb}^{-1})^{-1}$, and linear
combinations thereof.  Note that the tidal period (half the synodic
period) is not shown.  The bins are logarithmically spaced to give 100
bins between the minimum and maximum ordinate values.  The gray bands
express the range of values observed from the Poissonian draws.  While
it does seem like a rather odd coincidence for peaks in the observed
flare arrival time distribution to coincide with the locations of
these ``special intervals'', the statistical evidence for a
non-Poissonian process driving the flares does not seem particularly
strong.  More quantitatively, the peaks observed at the orbital and
synodic periods are within the $\pm 2$-$\sigma$ range of a
Poissonian process, and those at $P_{\rm orb}+P_{\rm syn}$ and $P_{\rm
orb}+2P_{\rm syn}$ are only slightly above this range. 
With that said,
future analyses of these data by investigators more versed in the
topic than ourselves could very well yield new insights.



\section{Companion Star and False Positive Assessment}
\label{app:companionstar}

    a binary.

    \label{fig:ao}
	}
\end{figure*}

Our analysis of archival Keck-NIRC2 Kp-band (2.12\,$\mu $m) imaging
revealed the existence of a previously unreported stellar neighbor,
unresolved in the Gaia source catalog {\bf FIXME: uncertainties}.  The
NIRC2 images yield a projected separation $\rho=0\farcs17$, with
$\Delta {\rm Kp} = 2.5$.  Using the measured Gaia EDR3 parallax for
the system, this implies a projected separation of 54\,AU.  The
presence of this star is consistent with the excess noise in the Gaia
astrometric time-series (see Section~\ref{app:companionstar}).  Given
the low chance of a star imaged within {\bf X.X arcseconds} to be a
chance companion along the line of sight, we proceed under the
assumption that it is bound, and that the Kepler\,1627 system is
binary.

Unforuntately, we do not have any reliable color information about
Kepler\,1627B.  Based on the
tabulation\footnote{\url{http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/EEM_dwarf_UBVIJHK_colors_Teff.txt},
version \texttt{2021/03/02}.} by \citet{pecaut_mamajek_2013}, the
measured NIR-contrast for a main sequence G8V star corresponds to a
spectral type for the companion of $\approx$M2V ($M_\star \approx
0.44\,M_\odot$).  However, the companion should have a longer
pre-main-sequence contraction phase than the primary, which would
imply that this mass is overestimated by $\sim10$ to $20\%$.

Could the companion be creating a false positive signal?  The
companion star contributes $\approx$1\% of the total flux observed in
the Kepler aperture (0.7-2.0\% V-band to G-band dmag difference from
EEM table; todo is fix using model spectra).  The observed transit has
a depth of 0.18\%.  An 18\% deep eclipse of the secondary star would
therefore be needed to produce a deep enough signal.  The shape of the
observed signal requires allowed impact parameters to span 0.02 to
0.73 (Table~\ref{tab:posterior}); the body transiting the secondary
would therefore need to be non-grazing with $R_3/R_2 \approx 0.42$.
Assuming a $\approx 0.42R_\odot$ radius of the imaged secondary, this
would imply a tertiary stellar radius of $\approx 0.2R_\odot$.  This
scenario ultimately yields a contradiction, because it would require
an ingress and egress phase that each span $\approx$40\% of the
transit duration ($\approx 65\,{\rm minutes}$).  The actual measured
ingress and egress duration is $\approx 15\,{\rm minutes}$),
4.4$\times$ shorter.

\paragraph{Stellar density implied by transit duration}
The duration of the transit ($2.823 \pm 0.057 hr$) and the implied
stellar density ($2.31 \pm 0.52\,{\rm g\,cm}^{-3}$) could in theory
help rule between whether the transiting body orbits the primary or
secondary star.  Ultimately, our stellar density measurement is not
precise enough to render the blend scenario implausible.  At 30 Myr, a
0.40\,$M_\odot$ solar-metallicity dwarf is $\approx 26\%$ larger than
when it is fully contracted on the main sequence (0.40\,$R_\odot$
vs{.} 0.50\,$R_\odot$; CITEALT: Choi et al, MIST grids).  The
theoretically implied companion density of $3.2\,{\rm g\,cm}^{-3}$ is
indeed larger than the primary star's density of $1.80\,{\rm
g\,cm}^{-3}$ (measured through the HIRES reconaissance spectroscopy).
However the stellar density measured from the transit fitting ($2.31
\pm 0.52\,{\rm g\,cm}^{-3}$) is only discrepant at the
$\approx$2-$\sigma$ level from the M-dwarf blend scenario.  It is
instead the combination of the flux contrast, transit depth, and
ingress duration that rule out this scenario.
